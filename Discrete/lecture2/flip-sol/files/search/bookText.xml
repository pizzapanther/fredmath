             A person deposits $1,000.00 in an account that yields 9% interest compounded annually.
              a)  Set up a recurrence relation for the amount in the account at the end of n years.
              b)  Find an explicit formula for the amount in the account at the end of n years.
              c)  How much money will the account contain after 100 years?

             Solution

                a)  The amount after  n − 1 years multiplied by 1.09 to give the amount after n years, since 9% of the
                    value must be added to account for the interest.  Therefore, we have a = 1.09a  . The initial
                                                                                       n         n− 1

                b)  Since multiplying by 1.09 for each year, the solution is  a = 1000 (1.09 ) .
                                                                           n

          Suppose that the number of bacteria in a colony triples every hour.

           a)  Set up a recurrence relation for the number of bacteria after n hours have elapsed.
           b)  If 100 bacteria are used to begin new colony, how many bacteria will be in the colony in 10 hours?
          Solution

             a)  Since the number of bacteria triples every hour, the recurrence relation should say that the number
                 of bacteria after n hours is 3 times the number of bacteria after n – 1 hours.
                 Let  a  denote the number of bacteria after n hours, this statement translates into the recurrence

          A factory makes custom sports cars at an increasing rate. In the first month only one car is made, in the
          second month two cars are made, and so on, with n cars made in the nth month.

                 Since n cars are made in the nth month then c = c    +  n, where  c   is the first  n–1 months

             Solution
                a)  We have one 1 and one 0, then two 1 and two 0, then three of each, and so on increasing the
                    repetition by one each time. Since we have only one at the end, then we need three 1 and four 0 to

                b)  A pattern is that the positive integers are increasing order, with odd number showing once and
                    each even number repeated.
                    Thus, the next terms are 9, 10, 10.

                 2 (n− 1)/2   if n is odd.

             h)  The nth term appears to be  !n  + 1.
                 Thus, the next three terms are 362881, 3628801, 39916801.

                Therefore max has the value  14

             Show that if  |ab and  |ba , where a and b are integers, then a = b or a = −b.

             Solution

                Let s and t are integers such that a =  bs and b =  at .
                 a =  bs =  ats . Since  ≠a  0 , we conclude that  st  = 1.
                The only way for this to happen, since s and t are integers, is for  = ts  = 1 or  s  = t  =  − 1.

                Therefore, either a = b or a = −b.

             Exercise

             Show that the binary expansion of a positive integer can be obtained from its hexadecimal expansion by
             translating each hexadecimal digit into a block of four binary digits.

             Solution

                Let ( h   h  h  )   be the hexadecimal expansion of a positive integer. The value of that integer is
                     

                If we replace each hexadecimal digit  h by its binary expansion (b  b  b  b  ) , then

          Show that the binary expansion of a positive integer can be obtained from its octal expansion by
          translating each octal digit into a block of three binary digits.

          Solution

             Let ( d  d  d  )  be the octal expansion of a positive integer. The value of that integer is
                      2  1  0  8

              d  + d  ⋅8 + d  ⋅8 2  +  = d  + d  ⋅ 2 2  + d  ⋅ 2 6  + 

             If we replace each octal digit  d by its binary expansion (b  b  b  ) , then

          Exercise
          Explain how to convert from binary to base 64 expansions and from base 64 expansions to binary
          expansions and from octal to base 64 expansions and from base 64 expansions to octal expansions

          Solution

                    8
                         2
              64 =  2 = 8 , in base 64 we need 64 symbols, from 0 to up to something representing 63.
             Corresponding to each such symbol would be a binary string of 6 digits, from 000000 for 0 to 001010
             for a, 100011 for z, 100100 for A, 111101 for Z, for 111110 for @, and 111111 for $.
             To translate from binary to base 64, we group the binary digits from the right in groups of 6 and use
             the list of correspondences to replace each 6 bits by one base-64 digits.

             To convert from base 64 to binary, we just replace each base-64 digit by its corresponding 6 bits.
             For conversion between octal and base 64, we change the binary strings in the table to octal strings,
             replacing each 6-bit string by its 2-digit octal equivalent, and then follow the same procedures as
             above, interchanging base-64 digits and 2-digits strings of octal digits.

          Which positive integers less than 12 are relatively prime to 12?


          Solution

             By inspection with mental arithmetic, the greatest common divisors of the numbers from 1 to 11 with
             12 whose gcd is 1, are 1, 5, 7, and 11. These are so few since 12 had many factors – in particular, both

          Which positive integers less than 30 are relatively prime to 30?

          Solution
             The prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5.

             Thus we are looking for positive integers less than 30 that have none of these prime factors. Since the

             (and the number 1) will satisfy this condition.
             Therefore the answer is 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 18, 23, and 29.

             Solution
                We will prove the assertion by proving its contrapositive.
                Suppose that n is not prime. Then by definition  n =  ab  for some integers a and b each greater than 1.
                Since  a >  1, 2 −  a  1, the first factor in the suggested identity, is greater than 1. The second factor is
                also greater than 1.
                       n
                Thus 2 −=      b   1 is the product of 2 integers each greater than 1, so it is not prime.

          Solution

                   7
             a)  2 −  1 = 127.     2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are not factors of 127, since  127 < 13 , therefore 127 is prime.

                   9
             b)  2 −  1 =  511 =  7 ⋅ 73  So this number is not prime.
             c)  2 11  − 1 =  2047 =  23⋅ 89   So this number is not prime.


             d)  2 13  − 1 =  8191.
                 Since  8191 <  97
                  then 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89 are
                 not factors of 8191, therefore 8191 is prime.

          Prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6.
          Solution

             Consider the product  ( nn +  1 )(n +  ) 2  for some integer n.
             Since every second integer is even (divisible by 2), then this product is divisible by 2.
             Since every third integer is divisible by 3, then this product is divisible by 3.
             Therefore, this product has both 2 and 3 in its prime factorization and is therefore divisible by  23 6⋅=


          Exercise


          Show that if a, b, and m are integers such that m ≥  and a ≡  ( b mod  m ), then gcd ( ,a  m ) gcd ,b m=  (  )
                                                           2
          Solution

             From a ≡   ( b mod  m ) we know that b =  a +  sm  for some integer s. If d is a common divisor of a and
             m, then it divides the right-hand side of this equation, so it also divides b. We can rewrite the equation
             as  a =  b − sm , and they by similar reasoning, we see that every common divisor of b and m is also a

             divisor of a.
             This shows that the set of common divisors of a and m is equal to the set of common divisors of b and

             m, so certainly gcd ( m a,  ) gcd=  ( m b,  )

             Solution

                If one digit change to a value not congruent to it modulo 9, then the modular equivalence implied by

             Exercise

             Determine which transposition errors are detected by the USPS money order code.

             Solution
                Because the first ten digits are added, any transposition error involving them will go undetected.
                The sum of the first ten digits will be the same for the transposed number as it is for the correct
                number.
                Suppose that the last digit is transposed with another digit; without loss of generality; we can assume

                it’s the tenth digit and that  x  ≠  x   .
                                            10    11
                Then the correct equation will be

                    x   ≡  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x  (mod    ) 9      ( ) 1
                     11    1    2    3    4    5    6     7    8    9    10
                But the equation resulting from the error will read
                    x   ≡  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x  (mod    ) 9      ( ) 2
                     10    1    2    3    4     5    6    7    8    9    11

                Subtract equations ( ) 2  & ( ) 1

                    x   −  x  ≡  x  −  x  (mod   ) 9
                     11    10    10    11
                    2x   ≡  2x  (mod    ) 9             Divide by 2 both sides since 2 is prime
                       11     10
                    x   ≡  x  (mod   ) 9   Which is false
                     11    10
                The check equation will fail.
                Therefore, we conclude that transposition errors involving the eleventh digits are detected.
