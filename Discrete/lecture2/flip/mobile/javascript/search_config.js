We use the notation  a  to denote the image of the integer n. We call  a  a term of                                                        n                                              n            the sequence.                           { }            The sequence  a  n  , where  a =  1                                         n                                             n            The list of the terms of this sequence: 1,  1 ,  1 ,  1 ,                                                      2   3  4              Definition                                                                a ar            A geometric progression is a sequence of the form  ,  , ar 2 ,   , ar n ,    where the initial term a and            the common ratio r are real numbers.

A sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms                    0            satisfy the recurrence relation. (A recurrence relation is said to recursively define a sequence.)                                                                  87","Example                 { }            Let  a n   be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation  a =  a n− 1  + 3 for  n  = 1, 2, 3,  and                                                                        n                               2            suppose that   a = .

A reasonable rule for generating this sequence is that the                integer n appears exactly n times.                The sequence generated this is possible match.

This produce to  a =  56+  (n −  ) 1 .                                                                                           n                                                                             6                                                                  5                This sequence is an arithmetic progression with  a =  and  d = .               Example             How can we produce the terms of a sequence if the first 10 terms are 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123?             Solution                4 = 1 + 3                7 = 4 + 3                11 = 4 + 7                And so on. We can see that the third term is the sum of the two previous term.                 The sequence is determined by the recurrence relation  L =  L  +  L    with initial conditions                                                                      n    n−  1   n−  2                                2                L =  1 and  L = .                 1          1                                                                        90","Some Useful Sequences                               2                              n      1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, …                               3                              n      1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, …                               4                              n      1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000, …                               n                              2      2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, …                               n                              3      3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, …                                ! n    1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, …                               f     1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …                               n                Summations             To find the sum of many terms of an infinite sequence, it is easy to express using summation notation.                                                 m                                                ∑  a =  k  a +  1  a +  2  a +  3  +  a m                                                 k  1 =                                                ∑   n =  a k  or  ∑   mk n   a                                                                             k                                                   k m                                                                       ≤≤            The index of summation runs through all integers starting with its lower limit and ending with its upper            limit.

Output: From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The                    output values are the solution to the problem.            Definiteness: The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.            Correctness: An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.             Finiteness: An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of                        steps for any input in the set.            Effectiveness: It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount                          of time.            Generality: The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a                         particular set of input values.

Solution                The input to Algorithm 1 is a sequence of integers. The output is the largest integer in the sequence.                Each step of the algorithm is precisely defined, because only assignments, a finite loop, and                conditional statements occur.                The values of the variable max equals the maximum terms when the algorithm terminates.                The initial value of max is the first term; as successive terms of the sequence are examined. This                argument shows that when all the terms have been examined, max equal the value of the largest                term and it will take n steps.                 Algorithm 1 is general, because it can be used to find the maximum of any finite sequence of                integers.                                  {                 Procedure max  a a     2  ,  , a n }                                     ,                                    1                 max:=  a                          1                 for i := 2 to n                       if max <  a then   max : a=                                   i                i                 return max{max is the largest element}              Searching Algorithms             Given a list, find a specific element in the list.

Solution                 Two integers are added by successively adding pairs of bits. Adding each pair of bits and the carry                requires two additions of bits. Thus, the total number of additions of bits used is less than twice the                number of bits in the expansion. Hence, the number of additions of bits used by Algorithm 2 to add                two n-bit integers is O(n).

A positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called composite.              Example            The integer 7 is prime because its only positive factors are 1 and 7.            The integer 9 is composite because its is divisible by 3.              Theorem − The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic             Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of two or more primes            where the prime factors are written in order of nondecreasing size.              Example              Find the prime factorization of 100, 641, 999, and 1024.

Hence, by               the definition of a factor, we have  n =  ab , b ( positive integer ) 1> .              If  a >  n  and b >    n , then  ab >  n ⋅  n =  n, which is a contradiction. Consequently,               a ≤   n and b ≤  n . Because both a and b are divisors of n, we see that n has a positive divisor not              exceeding  n . This divisor is either prime or, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, has a prime               divisor less than itself. In either case, n has a prime divisor less than or equal to  n .                                                              120","Example             Show that 101 is prime             Solution                 The only primes not exceeding  101  are 2, 3, 5, 7. Because 101 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (the                quotient of 101 and each of these integers is not an integer). It follows that 101 is prime.

Lemma 2             If a, b, and c are positive integers such that gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc, then a | c.             Proof              Assume gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc              Since gcd(a, b) = 1, by Bézout’s Theorem  there are integers s and t such that  sa + tb = 1.              Multiplying both sides of the equation by c, yields sac + tbc = c.   a | tbc and  a divides sac + tbc since              a | sac and a|tbc. We conclude a | c, since  sac + tbc = c.

Proof  (by contradiction)            Suppose that the positive integer n can be written as a product of primes in two distinct ways:                n =  pp     p  and  n = qq     q                     12       s          12       t            Remove all common primes from the factorizations to get                           pp        p  = q q       q                            i 1  i 2  i u    j 1  j 2  j v            By Lemma 3, it follows that    p  divides  q  , for some k, contradicting the assumption that  p  and                                           i 1         j k                                              i 1            q    are distinct primes.              j k            Hence, there can be at most one factorization of n into primes in nondecreasing order.               Dividing Congruences by an Integer             Theorem            Let m be a positive integer and let a, b, and c be integers. If ac ≡ bc (mod m) and gcd(c,m) = 1, then a ≡ b            (mod m).               Proof               Since ac ≡ bc (mod m), m | ac − bc = c(a − b)   by Lemma 2  and the fact that gcd(c,m) = 1, it follows              that   m | a − b.  Hence, a ≡ b (mod m).

A common hashing function is  h(k) = k mod m, where m is the number of memory locations. Because            this hashing function is onto, all memory locations are possible.              Example             Find the memory locations assigned by the hashing function h(k) = k mod 111 to the records of customers            with Social Security numbers 064212848, 037149212, and 107405723.             Solution                 This hashing function  assigns the records of customers with social security numbers as keys to                memory locations in the following manner:                   h(064212848) = 064212848 mod 111 = 14                     064212848 111*    578494 + 14                                                                                        =                   h (037149212) = 037149212 mod 111 = 65                    037149212 111*=   334677 +  65                                                                                         =                   h (107405723) = 107405723 mod 111 = 14                    107405723 111*    967619 + 14                But since location 14 is already occupied, the record is assigned to the next available position, which                is 15.               The hashing function is not one-to-one as there are many more possible keys than memory locations.            When more than one record is assigned to the same location, we say a collision occurs.  Here a collision            has been resolved by assigning the record to the first free location. For collision resolution, we can use a            linear probing function:                                     hk     ) (hk  i  =  ( ) ) mod  m ,  where i from 0 to m – 1.                                       ( , i                                                     ,            There are many other methods of handling with collisions. You may cover these in a later CS course.                                                                                132","Pseudorandom Numbers             Randomly chosen numbers are needed for many purposes, including computer simulations.            Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random since they are generated by systematic methods.            The linear congruential method is one commonly used procedure for generating pseudorandom numbers.             Four integers are needed: the modulus m, the multiplier a, the increment c, and seed x , with  2 a≤<  m , 0                                                                                              0                                                                                    { }            ≤ c < m,  0 ≤  x <  m .

If the final digit is not correct, then the string is assumed not to be correct.              Example             Retail products are identified by their Universal Product Codes (UPCs). Usually these have 12 decimal            digits, the last one being the check digit. The check digit is determined by the congruence:                         3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x  +  3x  +  x  ≡  0  (mod  10 )                          1    2     3    4    5    6     7    8     9    10     11   12               a)  Suppose that the first 11 digits of the UPC are 79357343104.
