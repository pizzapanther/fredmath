              a)  Boston is the capital of Massachusetts.
              b)  Miami is the capital of Florida
              c)  23 5
                    +=
              d)  5 7 10+=
                      2 11
              e)  x +=
              f)  Answer this question
              g)  Do not pass go
              h)  What time is it?
              i)  The moon is made of green cheese
                    n
              j)  2 ≥  100
             Solution

                a)  This is a true proposition
                b)  This is a false proposition, Tallahassee is the capital

                c)  This is a true proposition
                                                    +=
                d)  This is a false proposition since 57 12 ≠ 10
                e)  This is not a proposition. (The truth value depends on the value assigned to x.)

                f)  This is not a proposition, it is a command
                g)  This is not a proposition; it is a command

                h)  This is not a proposition; it’s a question
                i)  This is a proposition that is false

                j)  This is not a proposition; its truth value depends on the value of n.

          Exercise
          Suppose the Smartphone A has 256 MB RAM and 32 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 8 MP;
          Smartphone B has 288 MB RAM and 64 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 4 MP; Smartphone
          C has 128 MB RAM and 32 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 5 MP. Determine the truth
          value of each of these propositions.
           a)  Smartphone B has the most RAM of these three smartphones
           b)  Smartphone C has more ROM or higher resolution camera than Smartphone B.
           c)  Smartphone B has more RAM, more ROM, and a higher resolution camera than Smartphone A.
           d)  If Smartphone B has more RAM and more ROM than Smartphone C, then it also has a higher
               resolution camera.
           e)  Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B if and only if Smartphone B has more RAM than
               Smartphone A.

          Solution

             a)  This is a true proposition because 288 > 256 and 288 > 128
             b)  This is a true proposition, because the resolution is higher, C has 5 MP resolution compared to B’s
                 4 MP.
             c)  This is not a true proposition. The resolution is not higher that A.

             d)  This is not a true proposition. Not necessary, the resolution in B is not higher that C.
             e)  This is not a true proposition

             Solution

                The proposition  p ↔  is true when  p  and  q  have the same true or false value.  Since  p  and  q  are
                                      q

                truth, then  pq  only true. When  p  and  q  are false, then the negation  p¬  and  q¬  are true, then
                       q
                ¬ p ∧¬  is true. Therefore ( pq∧  ) ( p∨ ¬ ∧¬  ) q  is true only when both are true. Therefore these two
                expressions are logically equivalent.

             The proposition  ( p¬  ↔  ) q  is true when  p ↔  is false. Since  p ↔  is true when  p  and  q  have
             the same truth value, it is false when  p  and  q  have different truth values (either  p  is true and  q  is
                                                                              q

             false in the case which p is true and q is false the proposition is false, and true in the other three cases.
             Therefore these two expressions are logically equivalent.

          Show that  p¬↔  and  p ↔¬  are logically equivalent
          Solution

             The proposition  p¬↔  is true when  p¬  and  q  have the same truth values, which means that  p
                                    q
             and  q  have different truth values (either  p  is true and  q  is false, or vice versa). By the same
                                                                  q
             reasoning, these are exactly the cases in which  p ↔¬ is true. Therefore these two expressions are

             logically equivalent.

             Show that ( p →  q ) ( p∨  →  ) r  and  p →  (qr∨  )  are logically equivalent

             Solution
                ( p →  q ) ( p∨  →  ) r  will be true when either of the conditional statements is true. The conditional

                statement will be true if p is false, or if q in one case or r in the other case is true, when qr∨  is true,
                                             )
                which is precisely  p →  (qr  is true. Since the two propositions are true in exactly the same
                                          ∨
                situation, they are logically equivalent.


             Exercise

             Show that ( p →  r ) (q∨  →  ) r  and ( pq∧  ) →  r  are logically equivalent

             Solution

                In order for ( p →  r ) (q∨  →  ) r to be false, we must have both of the two implications false, which

                happens exactly when r is false and both p and q are true. But this precisely the case in which pq∧  is

                true and r is false, which is ( pq∧  ) →  r  is false. Therefore these two expressions are logically

                equivalent.



             Exercise

             Show that ( p →  q ∧  ) (q →  ) r →  ( p →  ) r  is a tautology

             Solution

                Given that p and  p →  are both true, we conclude that q is true; from that and q →  we conclude
                                      q
                                                                                                  r
                that r is true.



             Exercise

             Show that ( pq∨  ) ( pr∨¬ ∨  ) → (qr∨  ) is a tautology

             Solution

                The conclusion qr∨  will be true in every case except when q and r are both false. But if q and r are
                both false, then one of  pq∨  or  pr¬∨  is false, because one of p or  p¬  is false. Thus in this case

                ( pq∨  ) ( pr∧¬ ∨  )  is false. An conditional statement in which the conclusion is true or the hypothesis
                is false.

                    existence of a multiplication identity for the real numbers, and the statement is true, since we can
                    take  x = 1.

                c)  For every real number x and real number y, if x is nonnegative and y is negative, then the
                    difference  x y−  is positive. More simply, a nonnegative number minus a negative number is
                    positive which is true.

                d)  For every real number x and real number y, if x is positive and y is positive, then the product  xy  is
                    positive. More simply, a product of 2 positive numbers is positive.


                e)  For every real number x and real number y, there exists a real number z such that the product
                         z
                    xy = . More simply, the real numbers are closed under multiplication.

                a)  No matter how large n might be, we can always find an integer m bigger than  n . This is

             If n is odd, then n + 5 is even

             The proof by contradiction assumed that the implication was false, and showed a contradiction
               •  If we assume p and ¬q, we can show that implies q
               •  The contradiction is q and ¬q
               •  Note that both used similar steps, but are different means of proving the implication

             Use a direct proof to show that the sum of two odd integers is even.

             Solution

                Let m and n be two odd integers. Then there exists a and b such that  n =  2a + 1 and  m =  2b + 1.
                            1 2b +

                       =  ( 2 ab++  ) 1

                Since this represents nm+   as 2 times  ab++ 1, we conclude that  nm+   is even, as desired.

          Use a proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is
          irrational.

          Solution

             Let r is a rational number an s is irrational number then t =  rs  is an irrational.
                                                                        +

             Suppose that t is rational, then if t =  a   and  r =  c   where a, b, c, and d are integers with b ≠  and

              t +−     r   sr    s
             Therefore the assumption that t was rational was incorrect, and we conclude that t is irrational.

             if x is rational and  x ≠ , then by definition we can write  x =  , where p and q are nonzero integers.

          numbers. What kind of proof did you use?
          Solution

             Using proof of contradiction, then suppose all the number  a a  ,  , a are less than their average.
                                                                        ,

                                a +  a +    +  a
             By definition:  A =  1   2         n
                                        n
             The two displayed formulas clearly contradict each other, however: they imply that  nA <  nA . Thus
             our assumption must have been incorrect, and we conclude that at least one of the numbers  a  is
                                                                                                       1

                    729 + 729
                None of them works.

             Proof: The only two perfect squares that differ by 1 are 0 and 1
             Thus, any other numbers that differ by 1 cannot both be perfect squares
             Thus, a non-perfect square must exist in any set that contains two numbers that differ by 1

                 output values can be either integers or natural numbers. For example. If the input is 1010000, then
                 one might read the rule as stating that the function value is 3, since there are three more 0s than 1s;
                 but most people would probably consider the function value to be −3, obtained by subtracting in
                 the order stated:  25−= − . Then the range is Z.

             b)  The domain is the set of all bit strings. Since there can be any natural number of 0s in a bit string,
                 the value of the function can be 0, 2, 4, …. Therefore the range is the set of even natural numbers.

          Suppose that g is a function from A to B and f is a function from B to C.
           a)  Show that if both f and g are one−to−one functions, then  f g  is also one−to−one.
           b)  Show that if both f and g are onto functions, then  f g  is also onto.

          Solution

             a)  Assume that both f and g are one−to−one. We need to show that  f g  is also one−to−one. If x
                                                                         ( )) . First, since g is one−to−one, by
                                                              ( )) ≠
                 and y are two distinct elements of A, then  ( fg x   ( fg y
                                                            gx
                                                                      gy
                 definition  ( ) ≠  g ( ) y . Second, since now  ( )  and  ( )  are distinct elements of B, and since
                           gx
                                                                  ( ))  as desired.
                 f is one−to−one, we conclude that  ( fg x     ( fg y
                                                       ( )) ≠

             b)  Assume that both f and g are onto. We need to show that  f g  is onto. If z is any element of C,
                                                                ( )) = . First, since f is onto, we can conclude
                 then there is some element  x∈  such that  ( f gx    z
                                               A
                 that there is an element  y B∈  such that  ( ) = . Second, since g is onto and  y B∈ , we can
                                                                z
                                                        fy
                                                                                                    ( ))  as
                                                                 gx
                                                     A
                                                                        y
                 conclude that there is an element  x∈  such that  ( ) = . therefore  z =  f  ( ) y =  ( f gx
                 desired.
