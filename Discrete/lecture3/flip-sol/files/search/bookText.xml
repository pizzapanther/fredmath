             A pile of n rings, each smaller than the one below it, is on a peg on board. Two other pegs are attached
             to the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings must be moved, one at a time,
             to a different peg with no ring ever placed on top of a smaller ring. Find the least number of moves that
             would be required. Prove your result by mathematical induction.

             Give a recursive definition of

                  b)  The set of positive integers powers of 3

                  e)  The set of positive integers congruent to 2 modulo 3.
                  f)  The set of positive integers  not divisible by 5

             Solution

                a)  Off integers are obtained from other odd integers by adding 2. Thus we can define this set S as
                    follows 1 S ; and if  n S, then    n 
                             
                                                        2 S .
                b)  Powers of 3 are obtained from other powers of 3 by multiplying by 3. Thus we can define this
                    set S as follows 3 ; and if  n  S  S, then    3n  S .
                c)  There are several ways to do this. One that is suggested by Horner’s method is as follows. We
                                                                                                             S
                                                                                                      p
                    assume that the variable for these polynomials is the letter x. All integers are in S; if    x 
                                                  n
                    and n is any integer, then  xp x   is in S.
                    Another method constructs the polynomials term by term. Its base case is to let 0 be in S; and

                    its inductive step is to say that if    x  , c is an integer, and n is a nonnegative integer, then
                                                    p
                                                           S
                             n
                    p   x   cx  is in S.
                d)  Off integers are obtained from other even integers by adding 2. Thus we can define this set S as
                    follows  2 ; and if  n S, then    n            2 S
                                                         2 S   and   n  .
                               S
                                                                                   S
                e)  The smallest positive integer congruent to 2 modulo 3 is 2, so  2 . All the others can be
                    obtained by adding multiples of 3,so the inductive step is that  n S, then    n 
                                                                                                3 S
                f)  The positive integers no divisible by 5 are the ones congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. Thus we
                                                   
                                                        2 S,  
                    can define this set S as follows 1 S,     3 S, and   ; and if  n   S, then    n 
                                                                                                      5 S

                    Recursive step: If (a, b) ∊ S, then  , a  b    1   S , a  1,  b    1   and a   2, b    1 

              a)  List the elements of S produced by the first five applications of the recursive definition.
              b)  Use strong induction on the number of applications of the recursive step of the definition to show
                  that  a   2b  whenever (a, b) ∊ S.
              c)  Use structural induction to show that  a   2b  whenever (a, b) ∊ S.

             Solution
                a)  Apply each recursive step rules to the only element given in the basis step, we see that (0, 1),
                    (1, 1) and (2, 1) are in S.

                b)  Let    n  be the statement that  a   2b  whenever (a, b) ∊ S is obtained with no applications of
                        P
                    the recursive step.
                    For the basis step, the only element of S obtained with no applications of the recursive step is
                    0, 0    , then 0   2 0  is true. Therefore    0P   is true.
                    Assume that  a   2b  whenever (a, b) ∊ S is obtained by k or fewer applications of the recursive
                    step. Consider an element obtained with k + 1 applications of the recursive step.

                    There are 90 two-digit numbers (10 – 99), and all but 9 of them have distinct digits, so there are
                    81 two-digit numbers with distinct digits. Or the first digit 1 through 9 (9 choices), using the

                    the ones digit value nor 0 is available, therefore there are 40 such two-digit numbers (half of

             How many 4-permutations of the positive integers not exceeding 100 contain three consecutive

              a)  Where these consecutive integers can perhaps be separated by other integers in the permutation?
              b)  Where they are in consecutive positions in the permutation?

             Solution

                a)  The consecutive numbers are 5, 6, 7, since can be separate by other integers the permutation
                    can be written as 5, 6, 32, 7.
                    In order to specify such 4-permutation, we need to choose 3 consecutive integers. They can be
                    {1, 2, 3} to (98, 99, 100}; thus there are 98 possibilities. There are 4 possibilities, we need to
                    decide which 97 other positive integers not exceeding 100 is to fill this slot, and there are 97
                    choices.
                    In fact, every 4-permutation consisting of 4 consecutive numbers, in order, has been double
                    counted. Therefore we need to subtract the number of such 4-permutations. Clearly there are 97
                    of them. Further thought shows that every other 4-permutation in our collection arises in a

             A vending machine dispensing books of stamps accepts only one-dollar coins, $1 bills, and $5 bills.

                  where the order in which the coins and bills are deposited matter.
              b)  What are the initial conditions?
              c)  How many ways are there to deposit $10 for a book of stamps?

             Solution

                a)  Let  a  be the number of ways to deposit n dollars in the vending machine. We must express
                         n
                    a in terms of earlier terms in the sequence. If we want to deposit n dollars, we may start with
                     n
                    a dollar coin and then deposit n – 1 dollars. This gives us  a   ways to deposit n dollars.
                                                                             n 1
                    We can start with a dollar bill and then deposit n – 1 dollars. This gives us  a   more ways to

                    deposit n dollars.
                    Finally, we can deposit a five-dollar bill and follow that with n – 5 dollars; there are  a  ways
                                                                                                       n 5
                    to do this, Therefore the recurrence relation is  a   2a    a   for  n  5
                                                                  n      n  1  n  5

             a)  Find a recurrence relation for the number of bit strings of length n that contain three consecutive
                0s.

             c)  How many bit strings of length seven contain three consecutive 0s?

             Solution

                a)  Let  a  be the number of bit strings of length n containing three consecutive 0’s. In order to
                         n
                    construct a bit string of length n containing three consecutive 0’s we could start with 1 and
                    follow with a string of length n – 1 three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 01 and follow
                    with a string of length n – 2 three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 001 and follow with
                    a string of length n – 3 three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 000 and follow with a
                    string of length n – 3. These 4 cases are mutually exclusive and exhaust the possibilities for
                    how the string might start. We can write down the recurrence relation, valid for all
                    n  3: a    a     a      a      2 n 3

                b)  There are no bit strings of length 0, 1, or 2 containing 3 consecutive 0’s, so the initial
                    conditions are  a   a   a   0

             Exercise
             In how many ways can a  2 n  rectangular checkerboard be tiled using 1 2  and  2 2  pieces?

             Solution

                Let t  be the number of ways like to tile a  2 n  board with 1 2  and  2 2  pieces. To obtain the
                     n
                recurrence relation, imagine what tiles are placed at the left-hand end of the board. We can place a
                2 2  tile there, leaving a  2  n    2 board to be tiled, which of course can be done in t  ways.

                We can place a 1 2  tile at the edge, oriented vertically, leaving  2  n    1  board to be tiled, which

                of course can be done in t   ways. Finally, we can place two 1 2  tiles horizontally, one above
                                         n 1
                the other, leaving a   2  n    2  board to be tiled, which of course can be done in t  ways. These

                3 possibilities are disjoint.
