Exercise          A pile of n rings, each smaller than the one below it, is on a peg on board. Two other pegs are attached to         the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings must be moved, one at a time, to a         different peg with no ring ever placed on top of a smaller ring. Find the least number of moves that would         be required. Prove your result by mathematical induction.

Thus, we can define this set S as follows 1 S∈ ; and if  n S, then    n∈  +∈                                                                                     2 S .             b)  Powers of 3 are obtained from other powers of 3 by multiplying by 3.                Thus, we can define this set S as follows 3 S∈ ; and if  nS, then   ∈  3nS∈  .              c)  There are several ways to do this. One that is suggested by Horner’s method is as follows. We                                                                                                  px                assume that the variable for these polynomials is the letter x. All integers are in S; if  ( ) S∈  and n                                    xp                                            n                is any integer, then  ( ) x +  is in S.                Another method constructs the polynomials term by term. Its base case is to let 0 be in S; and its                inductive step is to say that if  ( ) S∈ , c is an integer, and n is a nonnegative integer, then                                              px                          n                 p ( ) x + cx  is in S.              d)  Off integers are obtained from other even integers by adding 2.                                                                                     2 S   and   n+                Thus, we can define this set S as follows  2 S∈ ; and if  n S, then    n∈  −∈       2 S∈ .             e)  The smallest positive integer congruent to 2 modulo 3 is 2, so 2 S∈ . All the others can be obtained                by adding multiples of 3, so the inductive step is that  n S, then    n∈  +∈                                                                                    3 S             f)  The positive integers no divisible by 5 are the ones congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5.                                                                                 ∈                Thus, we can define this set S as follows 1 S,∈  2∈  S,  3 ∈  S,  and  4 S ; and if                                 5 S                  ∈                 n S, then    n+∈                                                                   142","Exercise               Let S be the subset of the set of ordered pairs of integers defined recursively by                     Basis step: (0, 0) ∊ S.                     Recursive step: If (a, b) ∊ S, then (a +  2,  b +  ) 3 ∈  S  and (a +  3,  b +  ) 2 ∈  S                a)  List the elements of S produced by the first five applications of the recursive definition.               b)  Use strong induction on the number of applications of the recursive step of the definition to show that                   5 ab when (a, b) ∊ S.                       +               c)  Use structural induction to show that 5 ab when (a, b) ∊ S.                                                           +              Solution                  a)  Apply each recursive step rules to the only element given in the basis step, we see that (2, 3) and (3,                     2) are in S.

Solution              a)  The consecutive numbers are 5, 6, 7, since can be separate by other integers the permutation can be                written as 5, 6, 32, 7.                In order to specify such 4-permutation, we need to choose 3 consecutive integers. They can be {1,                2, 3} to (98, 99, 100}; thus, there are 98 possibilities.

In fact, every 4-permutation consisting of 4 consecutive numbers, in order, has been double                counted.                Therefore, we need to subtract the number of such 4-permutations.

Solution              a)  Let  a  be the number of ways to deposit n dollars in the vending machine.

These 3 cases are mutually exclusive and exhaust the possibilities for how the string might start                since it cannot start 000.                We can write down the recurrence relation, valid for all  n ≥  3: a =  a  +  a  +  a                                                                                n    n −  1  n −  2  n −  3              b)  There are no bit strings of length 0, 1, or 2 containing 3 consecutive 0’s, so the initial conditions are                 a =  1; a =  2 and     a =  4                  0        1             2              c)  a =  a +  a +  a                  3    2    1    0                    =  4 21                        ++                    = 7                  a =  a +  a +  a                  4    3    2    1                    =  7 42                        ++                    = 13                 a =  a +  a +  a                  5    4    3    2                         ++                    = 13 7 4                    =  24                 a =  a +  a +  a                  6    5    4    3                    =  24 13 7                             +                         +                    =  44                 a =  a +  a +  a                  7    6    5    4                         +                    =  44 24 13                              +                    =  81                Therefore, there are 81 bits of length 7 that do not contain three consecutive 0’s.                                                           170","Exercise               a)  Find a recurrence relation for the number of ways to climb n stairs if the person climbing the stairs can                 take one stair or two stairs at a time.              b)  What are the initial conditions?              c)  In how many can this person climb a flight of eight stairs               Solution                 a)  Let  a  be the number of ways to climb n stairs.
