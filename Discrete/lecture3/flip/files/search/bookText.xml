             Section 3.1  Mathematical Induction




             Introduction

             Suppose we have an infinite ladder:
                1.  We can reach the first rung of the ladder.
                2.  If we can reach a particular rung of the ladder,
                    then we can reach the next rung.

             From (1), we can reach the first rung. Then by
             applying (2), we can reach the second rung. Applying
             (2) again, the third rung. And so on.  We can apply (2)
             any number of times to reach any particular rung, no
             matter how high up.

             This example motivates proof by mathematical
             induction.







             Mathematical Induction

             Principle of Mathematical Induction
             To prove that P(n) is true for all positive integers n, we

             complete these steps:
                  Basis Step: Show that P(1) is true.
                  Inductive Step: Show that P(k) → P(k + 1)  is true for all positive integers k.

             To complete the inductive step, assuming the inductive hypothesis that P(k) holds for an arbitrary
             integer k, show that  must P(k + 1) be true.


             Climbing an Infinite Ladder Example:

              BASIS STEP: By (1), we can reach rung 1.
              INDUCTIVE STEP: Assume the inductive hypothesis that we can reach rung k. Then by (2), we can
                                  reach rung k + 1.
                  Hence, P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k. We can reach every rung on the ladder.

                                                              1]]></page><page Index="2"><![CDATA[Examples of Proofs by Mathematical induction

             Mathematical induction can be expressed as the rule of inference

                                           P   1     k P   k   P k  1    nP   n
             where the domain is the set of positive integers.

             In a proof by mathematical induction, we don’t assume that P(k) is true for all positive integers! We
             show that if we assume that P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) must also  be true.
             Proofs by mathematical induction do not always start at the integer 1. In such a case, the basis step
             begins at a starting point b where b is an integer.


             Validity of Mathematical Induction

             Mathematical induction is valid because of the well ordering property, which states that every
             nonempty subset of the set of positive integers has a least element. Here is the proof:
                Suppose that P(1) holds and P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k.
                Assume there is at least one positive integer n for which P(n) is false. Then the set S of positive
                  integers for which P(n) is false is nonempty.
                By the well-ordering property, S has a least element, say m.
                We know that m cannot be 1 since P(1) holds.
                Since m is positive and greater than 1, m − 1 must be a positive integer. Since m − 1 < m, it is not
                  in S, so P(m − 1) must be true.
                But then, since the conditional P(k) → P(k + 1)  for every positive integer k holds, P(m) must
                  also be true. This contradicts P(m) being false.
                Hence, P(n) must be true for every positive integer n

             Example

             Conjecture and prove correct a formula for the sum of the first n positive odd integers. Then prove
             your conjecture.

             Solution

                The sums of the first n positive odd integers for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are
                    1 = 1, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9,  1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.
                                               2
                Basis Step:  P(1) is true since 1  = 1.
                Inductive Step:  P(k) → P(k + 1) for every positive integer k.
                    Assume the inductive hypothesis holds and then show that P(k) holds has well.
                                                                   2
                    Inductive Hypothesis: 1 3 5        2k    1   k
                                            
                    So, assuming P(k), it follows that:
                                                       2
                                          2k 
                      
                    1 3 5        2k  1        1   k   2k    1
                                                        2
                                                      k   2k 
                                                                1
                                                             2
                                                      k    1     

                Hence, we have shown that P(k + 1) follows from P(k). Therefore the sum of the first n positive
                                2
                odd integers is n .

             For an arbitrary nonnegative integer k, every set with k elements has  2  subsets.

             Let T be a set with k + 1 elements. Then T   S    a , where a ∈ T and S = T − {a}.  Hence |T| = k.

             For each subset X of S, there are exactly two subsets of T, i.e., X and   X    a .

             Show that every  2   2  checkerboard with one square removed can be tiled using right triominoes.
             A right triomino is an L-shaped tile which covers three squares at a time.

                using right triominoes. Use mathematical induction to prove that P(n) is true for all positive
                integers n.
                Basis Step:  P(1) is true, because each of the four 2 ×2 checkerboards with one square removed can
                be tiled using one right triomino.







                                                                     k

                Inductive Step:  Assume that  P(k) is true for every   2  2 checkerboard, for some positive
                integer k. with one square removed can be tiled using right triominoes.

                    Consider a 2 k+1  ×2 k+1  checkerboard with one square removed. Split this checkerboard into four
                                          k
                                              k
                    checkerboards of size 2  ×2 ,by dividing it in half in both directions.

                                                           k
                    Remove a square from one of the four  2   2 checkerboards. By the inductive hypothesis, this
                    board can be tiled.  Also by the inductive hypothesis, the other three boards can be tiled with
                    the square from the corner of the center of the original board removed. We can then cover the
                    three adjacent squares with a triominoe.
                                      k  1  k  1
                    Hence, the entire  2    2    checkerboard with one square removed can be tiled using right
                    triominoes.

             Recursive Algorithms

             Definition
             A recursive or inductive definition of a function consists of two steps.

              1.  BASIS STEP: Specify the value of the function at zero.
              2.  RECURSIVE STEP: Give a rule for finding its value at an integer from its values at smaller
                  integers.


             Example

             Suppose f is defined by:
                     f    0   3
                       f n    1   2 f n 
                                    3
             Find f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4)

             Solution

                f(1) = 2f(0) + 3 = 2∙3 + 3 = 9
                f(2) = 2f(1)+ 3 = 2∙9 + 3 = 21
                f(3) = 2f(2) + 3 = 2∙21 + 3 = 45
                f(4) = 2f(3) + 3 = 2∙45 + 3 = 93


             Example


             Give a recursive definition of the factorial function n!
             Solution

                f(0) = 1
                f(n + 1) = (n + 1)∙ f(n)
                These 2 equations define n!


             Example
                                           n
             Give a recursive definition of  a , where a is a nonzero real number and n is a nonnegative integer.
             Solution

                  0
                a   1
                  n 1      n

                These 2 equations define  a  for all nonnegative integers n.

             Recursive definitions of sets have two parts:
                  The basis step specifies an initial collection of elements.
                  The recursive step gives the rules for forming new elements in the set from those already
                    known to be in the set.

             Sometimes the recursive definition has an exclusion rule, which specifies that the set contains nothing
             other than those elements specified in the basis step and generated by applications of the rules in the
             recursive step.

             We will always assume that the exclusion rule holds, even if it is not explicitly mentioned.
             We will later develop a form of induction, called structural induction, to prove results about
             recursively defined sets.



             Example

             Consider the subset S of the set of integers recursively defined by

                Basis step: 3 ∊ S.
                Recursive step: If x ∊ S and y ∊ S, then x + y is in S.
                   Initially 3 is in S, then 3 + 3 = 6, then 3 + 6 = 9, etc.


             Example

             Consider the subset N of the set of natural numbers recursively defined by

                Basis step: 0 ∊ N.
                Recursive step: If n is in N, then n + 1 is in N.

                    Initially 0 is in S, then 0 + 1 = 1, then 1 + 1 = 2, etc.

             Example

             Show that the set S defined  by specifying that 3 ∊ S and that if x ∊ S and   y ∊  S, then x + y is in S, is
             the set of all positive integers that are multiples of 3.
             Solution

                Let A be the set of all positive integers divisible by 3.
                To prove that A = S, show that A is a subset of S and S is a subset of A.
                    A⊂ S:  Let P(n) be the statement that 3n belongs to S.

                           Basis step:  3∙1 = 3 ∊ S, by the first part of recursive definition.
                           Inductive step:  Assume P(k) is true. By the second part of the recursive definition, if 3k
                           ∊ S, then since 3 ∊ S, 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1) ∊ S. Hence, P(k + 1) is true.
                    S ⊂ A:
                           Basis step:  3 ∊ S by the first part of recursive definition, and   3 = 3∙1.
                           Inductive step:  The second part of the recursive definition adds  x + y to S, if both x and
                           y are in S. If x and y are both in A, then both x and y are divisible by 3. It follows that
                           x   is divisible by 3.

                Use structural induction.

                           Hence, n(T) = 1  ≤ 2 0+1  – 1   = 1.

             Basic Counting Principle

             The Product Rule
             A procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. There are  n  ways to do the first task
                                                                                    1
             and  n  ways to do the second task. Then there are  n  n ways to do the procedure

                Since each of the seven bits is either a 0 or a 1, the answer is 2  = 128.

             are there to assign different offices to these two employees?
             Solution
                The procedure of assigning offices to these 2 employees consists of assigning an office to one employee,
                which can be done in 12 ways, then assigning an office to the second different from the office assigned to
                the first, which can be done in 11 ways.
                By the product rule, there are 12 11  132  wa  s y  to assign offices to these 2 employees.

                                                  1                    2

             Example

             The mathematics department must choose either a student or a faculty member as a representative for a
             university committee. How many choices are there for this representative if there are 37 members of
             the mathematics faculty and 83 mathematics majors and no one is both a faculty member and a student.

             Solution
                By the sum rule it follows that there are 37 + 83 = 120 possible ways to pick a representative.


             Example

             A student can choose a computer project from one of three lists. The three lists contain 23, 15, and 19
             possible projects, respectively. No project is on more than one list. How many possible projects are
             there to choose from?

             Solution

                Since no project is on more than one list, by the sum rule there are 23 + 15 + 19 = 57 ways to
                choose a project.



             The Sum Rule in terms of sets

             The sum rule can be phrased in terms of sets.
                    |A ∪ B|= |A| + |B| as long as A and B are disjoint sets.

             ways. Also known as, the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  A  B   A   B   A  B




             Example

             How many bit strings of length eight either start with a 1 bit or end with the two bits 00?

             Solution

                Use the subtraction rule.
                                                                               7
                  Number of bit strings of length eight that start with a 1 bit:   2  128

                    with bits 00 : 2  32
                Hence, the number is 128 + 64 − 32 = 160.


             Example

             A computer company receives 350 applications from computer graduates for a job planning a line of
             new Web servers. Suppose that 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in
             business, and 51 majored both in computer science and in business. How many of these applicants
             majored neither in computer science nor in business?

             Solution

                Let   A: majored in computer science

                      B: majored in business

                 A   B   A   B   A  B

                350 316     34

                We conclude that 34 of the applicants majored neither in computer science nor in business

             Definition
             There are n/d ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n ways,
             and for every way w, exactly d of the n ways correspond to way w.
               Restated in terms of sets: If the finite set A is the union of n pairwise disjoint subsets each with d
                elements, then n = |A|/d.
               In terms of functions: If f is a function from A to B, where both are finite sets, and for every value y
                ∈ B there are exactly d values x ∈ A such that f(x) = y, then   |B| = |A|/d.



             Example

             How many ways are there to seat four people around a circular table, where two seatings are
             considered the same when each person has the same left and right neighbor?

             Solution

                Number the seats around the table from 1 to 4 proceeding clockwise.
                There are four ways to select the person for seat 1, 3 for seat 2, 2, for seat 3, and one way for seat
                4.
                Thus there are 4! = 24 ways to order the four people.
                But since two seatings are the same when each person has the same left and right neighbor, for
                every choice for seat 1, we get the same seating.
                Therefore, by the division rule, there are 24/4 = 6 different seating arrangements.

             Permutation

             A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an arrangement of the objects is a specific Order Without

             r –permutation of a set with n distinct elements.

             Proof
                Use the product rule. The first element can be chosen in n ways. The second in n −  1 ways, and so
                on until there are (n − ( r − 1)) ways to choose the last element.

             Definition

             An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection of r elements from the set. Thus, an
             r-combination is simply a subset of the set with r elements

             Combination of a set of n distinct objects taken r @ a time without repetition is an r element subset

             Example

             Let S be the set {a, b, c, d}. Then {a, c, d} is a 3-combination from S. It is the same as {d, c, a} since
             the order listed does not matter.
             Solution

                C(4,2) = 6 because the 2-combinations of {a, b, c, d} are the six subsets
                 {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d}, {b, c}, {b, d}, and {c, d}.


             Theorem
             The number of r-combinations of a set with n elements, where n ≥ r ≥ 0, equals

             Proof
                By the product rule P(n, r) = C(n, r) ∙ P(r, r). Therefore,

                                         ! n

             ways are there to select 47 cards from a deck of 52 cards?

             Solution
                Since the order in which the cards are dealt does not matter, the number of five card hands is:

             Proof
                                                       

             Definition

             A combinatorial proof of an identity is a proof that uses one of the following methods.
                A double counting proof uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of an identity count the
                  same objects, but in different ways.
                A bijective proof  shows that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the two
                  sides of the identity.

             Modeling with Recurrence Relations

             Definition

             A recurrence relation for the sequence {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of
                                                              ,
             the previous terms of the sequence, namely,  a  , a    , a  , for all integers n with  n   n , where
                                                         0   1       n 1                           0
             n  is a nonnegative integer
              0


             Example

             A young pair of rabbits (one of each gender) is placed on an island. A pair of rabbits does not breed
             until they are 2 months old. After they are 2 months old, each pair of rabbits produces another pair
             each month. Find a recurrence relation for the number of pairs of rabbits on the island after n months,
             assuming that rabbits never die.




























                                    Modeling the Population Growth of Rabbits on an Island

             Solution
                Let  f  be the number of pairs of rabbits after n months.
                      n
                      There are is  f   pairs of rabbits on the island at the end of the first month.

                                     1
                      We also have  f   because the pair does not breed during the first month.
                                          1
                                       2
                      To find the number of pairs on the island after n months, add the number on the island after
                       the previous month,  f   , and the  number of newborn pairs, which equals  f   , because
                                             n 1                                                 n 2
                       each newborn pair comes from a pair at least two months old.

                Consequently the sequence  f  n  satisfies the recurrence relation  f  n    f n  1    f n  2   for  n ≥  3 with

                the initial conditions   f   and   f  .

                The number of pairs of rabbits on the island after n months is given by the nth Fibonacci number.


             The Tower of Hanoi

             In the late nineteenth century, the French mathematician Édouard Lucas invented a puzzle, called the
             Tower of Hanoi, consisting of three pegs on a board with disks of different sizes. Initially all of the
             disks are on the first peg in order of size, with the largest on the bottom

             Rules: You are allowed to move the disks one at a time from one peg to another as long as a larger
                    disk is never placed on a smaller.

             Goal: Using allowable moves, end up with all the disks on the second peg in order of size with largest
                    on the bottom.




















             Solution

                     
                Let  H  n  denote the number of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle with n disks. Set
                                                          
                up a recurrence   relation for the sequence  H  n  . Begin with n disks on peg 1. We can transfer the

                top n −1 disks, following the rules of the puzzle, to peg 3 using  H  moves.
                                                                                n 1
                First, we use 1 move to transfer the largest disk to the second peg. Then we  transfer the  n −1 disks
                from peg 3 to peg 2 using  H     additional moves. This cannot be done in fewer steps. Hence,
                                            n 1

                           H     2H       1
                             n       n 1
                                               1
                    The initial condition is  H   since a single disk can be transferred from peg 1 to peg 2 in one
                                           1
                move.

                disks from one peg to another following the rules of the puzzle.  They move one disk each day.

             two consecutive 0s. How many such bit strings are there of length five?
             Solution

                Let an  denote the number of bit strings of length  n without two consecutive 0s.  To obtain a
                                       
                recurrence relation for  a n   note that the number of bit strings of length n that do not have two

                consecutive 0s is the number of bit strings ending with a 0 plus the number of such bit strings
                ending with a 1.
                   Now assume that n ≥ 3.
                 The bit strings of length n ending with 1 without two consecutive 0s are the bit strings of length n

                −1 with no two consecutive 0s with a 1  at the end. Hence, there are  a   such bit strings.
                                                                                   n 1
                The bit strings of length n ending with 0 without two consecutive 0s are the bit strings of length n

                −2 with no two consecutive 0s with 10  at the end. Hence, there are  a   such bit strings.
                                                                                   n 2

                The initial conditions are:
                        a   2 , since both the bit strings 0 and 1 do not have consecutive 0s.
                         1

                string can be obtained from strings of n – 1 digits. There are two ways to form a valid string with n
                digits from a string with one fewer digit.

                1.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a valid string of n – 1 digits with a
                    digit other than 0. This appending can be done in 9 ways. Hence, a valid string with n digits can
                    be formed in this manner in 9a    ways.
                                                  n 1
                2.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a 0 to a string of length n – 1 that is
                    not valid. The number of ways that this can be done equals the number of invalid (n – 1)-digit
                                               n 1
                    strings. Because there are 10   strings of length n – 1, and  a   are valid, there are
                                                                                n 1
                      n 1
                    10      a    valid n –digit strings obtained by appending an invalid string of length n – 1 with
                             n 1
                    a 0.

                    Because all valid strings of length n are produced in one of these two ways, it follows that there
                    are

             Definition

             A linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree k with constant coefficients is a recurrence
             relation of the form
                           a     c  a     c  a         c  a
                             n    1  n1     2  n2         k  n k

             Where c   , c ,  c   ,   are real numbers, and   c    0
                     1   2      k                         k

               It is linear because the right-hand side is a sum of the previous terms of the sequence each
                multiplied by a function of n.

               It is homogeneous because no terms occur that are not multiples of the  a  s . Each coefficient is a
                                                                                       j
                constant.

                The degree is k  because   a  is expressed in terms of the previous k terms of the sequence.

             Solving Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relations

                                                                         n
             The basic approach is to look for solutions of the form   a    r , where r is a constant.
                                                                    n
                             n
             Note that  a    r  is a solution to the recurrence relation  a    c  a    c  a     c  a     if
                        n                                             n     1  n1    2  n2         k  n k
             and only if   r n    c  r n1    c  r n2     c  r n k .
                               1         2              k
             Algebraic manipulation yields the characteristic equation:

                             r  k   c  r  k  1   c  r k  2    c  r  n  k    0
                                  1         2              k   1
                                           n
             The sequence {an} with  a    r  is a solution if and only if r is a solution to the characteristic
                                      n
             equation. The solutions to the characteristic equation are called the characteristic roots of the
             recurrence relation. The roots are used to give an explicit formula for all the solutions of the recurrence
             relation.


             Theorem

             Let  c  and  c  be real numbers. Suppose that  r  2   c  r   c    0  has two distinct roots r  and  r .
                  1       2                                     1     2                            1      2
             Then the sequence {an} is a solution to the recurrence relation  a   c  a   c  a   if and only if

                                                              n
             This shows that the sequence   with  a      r     r  is a solution of the recurrence relation.

             An Explicit Formula for the Fibonacci Numbers

             Example

             We can use Theorem to find an explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers. The sequence of Fibonacci
             numbers satisfies the recurrence relation  f   f    f        with the initial conditions:  f    0
                                                      n     n  1   n  2                              0
             and  f   1.

             Solution

                 Therefore, from the theorem it follows that the Fibonacci numbers are given by
                                                                  n               n

                The solution to these simultaneous equations for    and   is      1   and       1
                                                                  1       2     1     5        2       5

             Solution
                The associated linear homogeneous equation is  a    3a   .
                                                                n     n 1

                Because F(n)= 2n is a polynomial in n of degree one.
                Let the linear function  p   cn   d  be such a solution
                                        n
                Then  a    3a      2n  becomes   cn + d = 3(c(n− 1) + d)+ 2n.
                       n      n 1
                     (2 + 2c)n + (2d − 3c)  = 0.
                It follows that cn + d is  a solution if and only if 2 + 2c  = 0 and 2d − 3c  = 0.
                Therefore, cn + d is  a solution if and only if c = − 1 and d = − 3/2.
