We can reach the first rung of the ladder.                  2.  If we can reach a particular rung of the ladder,                     then we can reach the next rung.               From (1), we can reach the first rung.              Then by applying (2), we can reach the second rung.              Applying (2) again, the third rung. And so on.               We can apply (2) any number of times to reach any              particular rung, no matter how high up.               This example motivates proof by mathematical induction.

INDUCTIVE STEP: Assume the inductive hypothesis that we can reach rung k. Then by (2), we can                                reach rung k + 1.                Hence, P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k. We can reach every rung on the ladder.             Examples of Proofs by Mathematical induction            Mathematical induction can be expressed as the rule of inference                                                                ( +                                                       ( ) →                                         ( P ( ) 1 ∧∀  ( k Pk  Pk   1 ))) → ∀ nPn                                                                               ( )           where the domain is the set of positive integers.           In a proof by mathematical induction, we don’t assume that P(k) is true for all positive integers! We show           that if we assume that P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) must also  be true.            Proofs by mathematical induction do not always start at the integer 1. In such a case, the basis step begins           at a starting point b where b is an integer.             Validity of Mathematical Induction            Mathematical induction is valid because of the well ordering property, which states that every nonempty           subset of the set of positive integers has a least element. Here is the proof:               Suppose that P(1) holds and P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k.               Assume there is at least one positive integer n for which P(n) is false. Then the set S of positive                integers for which P(n) is false is nonempty.              By the well-ordering property, S has a least element, say m.               We know that m cannot be 1 since P(1) holds.               Since m is positive and greater than 1, m − 1 must be a positive integer. Since m − 1 < m, it is not in                S, so P(m − 1) must be true.               But then, since the conditional P(k) → P(k + 1)  for every positive integer k holds, P(m) must also                be true. This contradicts P(m) being false.               Hence, P(n) must be true for every positive integer n                                                                           138","Example                                                                      ( nn +  ) 1                                                      ++              Show that if n is a positive integer, then 12  + n =                                                                       2              Solution                                        ( 11 1+  )                 (1)  For n = 1 ⇒ 1=                                         2                                   1 1=     √                            Hence  P  is true.                                   1                 (2)  Assume that  P  is true.                                     k                                                                           ( kk +  ) 1                       Thus, the induction hypothesis is: 12 3+ ++ +  k =                                                                             2                                                              ?

Two other pegs are                attached to the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings must be moved,                one at a time, to a different peg with no ring ever placed on top of a smaller ring.                 Find the least number of moves that would be required.

Sometimes the recursive definition has an exclusion rule, which specifies that the set contains nothing           other than those elements specified in the basis step and generated by applications of the rules in the           recursive step.           We will always assume that the exclusion rule holds, even if it is not explicitly mentioned.            We will later develop a form of induction, called structural induction, to prove results about recursively           defined sets.

The Tower of Hanoi            In the late nineteenth century, the French mathematician Édouard Lucas invented a puzzle, called the           Tower of Hanoi, consisting of three pegs on a board with disks of different sizes. Initially all of the disks           are on the first peg in order of size, with the largest on the bottom            Rules: You are allowed to move the disks one at a time from one peg to another as long as a larger disk is                  never placed on a smaller.            Goal: Using allowable moves, end up with all the disks on the second peg in order of size with largest on                  the bottom.

The bit strings of length n ending with 1 without two consecutive 0s are the bit strings of length n −1              with no two consecutive 0s with a 1  at the end. Hence, there are  a   such bit strings.                                                                              n− 1              The bit strings of length n ending with 0 without two consecutive 0s are the bit strings of length n −2              with no two consecutive 0s with 10  at the end. Hence, there are  a   such bit strings.                                                                              n− 2               We conclude that  a =  a    +  a     for n ≥ 3.                                 n     n−  1  n−  2              The initial conditions are:                       a =  2 , since both the bit strings 0 and 1 do not have consecutive 0s.                       1                      a =  3, since the bit strings 01, 10, and 11 do not have consecutive 0s, while 00 does.                       2                 To obtain  a , we use the recurrence relation three times to find that:                            5                    a =  a +  a =  32 5+=                     3    2    1                    a =  a +  a = + =                                   53 8                     4     3    2                    a =  a +  a =  8 5 13+=                     5     4    3                                                                                          186","Example               A computer system considers a string of decimal digits a valid code-word if it contains an even number of              0 digits. For instance, 1230407869 is valid, whereas 1230407869 is not valid. Let  a  be the number of                                                                                              0              valid n-digit code-words.

There are two ways to form a valid string with n digits from a                 string with one fewer digit.                   1.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a valid string of n – 1 digits with a digit                     other than 0. This appending can be done in 9 ways. Hence, a valid string with n digits can be                     formed in this manner in 9a     ways.                                                n− 1                  2.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a 0 to a string of length n – 1 that is not                     valid. The number of ways that this can be done equals the number of invalid (n – 1)-digit strings.                      Because there are 10 n− 1  strings of length n – 1, and  a   are valid, there are 10 n− 1  − a   valid                                                                         n− 1                            n− 1                     n –digit strings obtained by appending an invalid string of length n – 1 with a 0.                      Because all valid strings of length n are produced in one of these two ways, it follows that there                     are                             a =  9a     +  ( 10 n− 1 −  a  )                              n     n−  1           n−  1                                 = 8a    + 10 n− 1                                    n− 1                        Valid strings of length n.                                                                                        187","Example            Find a recurrence relation for C , the number of ways to parenthesize the product of  n + 1 numbers,                                         n           x ⋅  x ⋅  x   x ⋅  , to specify the order of multiplication.
