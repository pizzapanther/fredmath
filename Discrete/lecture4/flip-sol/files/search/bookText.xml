          Solution

             a)  This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) is not included
                 It is not symmetric, since (2, 4) is included but not (4, 2)
                 It is not antisymmetric, since it includes (2, 3) and (3, 2) but 2 ≠ 3

             c)  This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) is not included
                 It is symmetric, since (2, 4) and (4, 2) are included
                 It is not antisymmetric, since it includes (2, 4) and (4, 2) but 2 ≠ 4
                 It is not transitive, since it includes (2, 4) and (4, 2) but not (2, 2)
             d)  This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) is not included
                 It is not symmetric, since (1, 2) is included but not (2, 1)
                 It is antisymmetric, since no cases of (a, b) and (b, a) both being in the relation

             Determine whether the relation R on the set of all people is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and/or

             transitive, where ( , a b ) R∈  if and only if
              a)  a is taller than b.
              b)  a and b were born on the same day
              c)  a has the same first name as b.
              d)  a and b have a common grandparent.

             Solution

                a)  I am not taller than myself, therefore being taller is not reflexive
                    It is not symmetric, since I am taller than my kid but my kid is not
                    It is antisymmetric since we never have a taller than b and b taller than a even if a = b
                    It is transitive since if a taller than b and b taller than c that implies that A taller then c
                b)  The relation is reflexive since a is born on the same day
                    It is symmetric, since a and b were born on the same day
                    It is not antisymmetric since a and b were born on the same day but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a and b were born on the same day and b and c were born on the same day
                    that implies that a and c were born on the same day

                c)  The relation is reflexive since a has the same first name as a
                    It is symmetric, since a has the same first name as b than b has the same first name as a

                    It is not antisymmetric since a has the same first name as b but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a has the same first name as b and c has the same first name as c that
                    implies that a has the same first name as c

                d)  The relation is reflexive since a and a have a common grandparent
                    It is symmetric, since a and b have a common grandparent than b and a have a common
                    grandparent
                    It is not antisymmetric since a and b have a common grandparent but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a and b have a common grandparent and b and c have a common
                    grandparent that implies that a and c have a common grandparent

                    It is symmetric, since  x y+=  then  yx+=  because  x +=     yx

             Solution
                a)  This relation is not reflexive, since 1 ≠ 1 for instance
                    It is symmetric, if  x ≠  y ⇒  y ≠  x

                    It is not antisymmetric since 1 2≠ ⇒ 21

                    It is not transitive since 1 2 and ≠  2 1≠⇒ 11
                b)  This relation is not reflexive, since (0, 0) is not included  0 ≥ (  ) 1

                    It is symmetric, because  xy =  yx (commutative property of multiplication)
                    It is not antisymmetric since (2, 3) and (3, 2) are both included
                    It is transitive holds between x and y if and only if either x and y are both positive or x and y are
                    both negative

                c)  This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) is not included (1 1≠ +  ) 1
                                                                        x
                    It is symmetric, because  x = − 1 is equivalent to  y = + 1
                                                y
                    It is not antisymmetric since (1, 2) and (2, 1) are in the relation
                    It is not transitive since (1, 2) and (2, 1) are in the relation but (1, 1) is not

                    It is symmetric since is  x  ≡  ( y mod  ) 7  then  x y−= 7t , therefore  yx−=  7 ( ) t−  so  y  ≡  ( x mod  ) 7

                    It is transitive since  x  ≡  ( y mod  ) 7  means  x y−= 7t  and  y  ≡  ( z mod  ) 7  means  yz  7s

          Let R be the relation on the set of all states in the U.S. consisting of pairs (a, b) where state a borders state
          b. Find

                 a)  R − 1     b)   R
          Solution

             a)  Since this relation is symmetric,  R − 1  =  R

             b)  This relation consists of all pairs (a, b) in which state a does not border state b.

          Exercise

          Let R be the relation on the set {0, 1, 2, 3} containing the ordered pairs (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0),
          (2, 2), and (3, 0).  Find the
             a)  Reflexive closure of R.
             b)  Symmetric closure of R.

          Solution
             a)  The reflexive closure of R is R with all (a, a). In this case the closure of R is
                 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3)}


             b)  The symmetric closure of R is R with (b, a) for which (a, b) is in R.
                 In this case the symmetric of R is
                 {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0) (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,0), (2, 1) (2, 2), (3, 0)}

          Let R be the relation  ( { ,a b a ≠  } b  on the set of integers. What is the reflexive closure of R?
          Solution

             When we add all the pairs (x, x) to the given relation we have all of  Z×Z, which the relation will
             always holds.

          Let R be the relation  ( { , a  b a divides b  on the set of integers. What is the symmetric closure of R?
                                    ) |
          Solution

             To form the symmetric closure, we need to add all the pairs (b, a) such that (a, b) is in R.
             We need to include pairs (b, a) such that a divides b, which is equivalent to saying that we need to
             include all the pairs (a, b) such that b divides a.
             Thus the closure is {(a, b) | a divides b or b divides a}


          Exercise

          How can the directed graph representing the reflexive closure of a relation on a finite set be constructed
          from the directed graph of the relation?
          Solution

             To form a reflexive closure, we simply need to add a loop at each vertex that does not already have
             one.

                a)  This relation is reflexive, since a is the same person (same age).
                    If a is the same age as b, then b has to be the same age as a. this relation is symmetric.
                    If a is the same age as b and b is the same age as c,  then a has to be the same age as c. this relation
                    is transitive.
                    An equivalence class is the set of all people who are the same age. To really identify the
                    equivalence class and the equivalence relation itself, one would need to specify exactly what ine
                    meant by the  “same age”. For example, we could define two people to be the same age if their
                    official dates of birth were identical.
                b)  For each pair (m, w) of a man and a woman, the set of offspring of their union, if nonempty, is an
                    equivalence class. In many cases, then, an equivalence class consists of all the children in a
                    nuclear family with children.
                c)  Let assume the relation is biological parentage. It is possible that a to be the the child of W and X,
                    b is the child of X and Y, and c is the child of Y and Z.  Then a is related to b, and b is related to c,
                    but a is not related to c. This is not an equivalence relation, since it is not transitive. Therefore, this
                    is not an equivalence relation.
                d)  If a met b and b met c, then it is not neccesary that a met c. This is not an equivalence relation,
                    since it is not transitive. Therefore, this is not an equivalence relation.
                e)  If a speaks the same language (english) as b and b speaks the same language (spanish) as c, then it
                    is not neccesary that a can speak spanish as c. This is not an equivalence relation, since it is not
                    transitive.

          Exercise

          Define three equivalence relations on the set of students in your discrete mathematics class different from
          the relations discussed in the text. Determine the equivalence classes for each of these equivalence
          relations.

          Solution

             One relation is that a and b are related if they were born in the same state. Here the equivalence
             classes are the nonempty sets of students from each state.
             Another example is for a to be related to b if a and b have lived the same number of complete
             decades. The equivalence classes are the set of all 10 to 19 years olds. The set of all 20 to 29 year
             olds, and so on.
             A Third example is a to be related to b if 10 is a divisor of the difference between a’s age and b’s age,
             where “age” means the whole number of years since birth, as of the first day of class.

             Define three equivalence relations on the set of buildings on a college campus. Determine the equivalence
             classes for each of these equivalence relations.

             Solution

                Two buildings are equivalent, if they were opened during the same year; an equivalence class consists
                of the set of buildings opened in a given year.
                For another example, we can define 2 buildings to be equivalent if they have the same number of
                stories; the equivalence classes are the set of 1-story buildings, the set of 2-story buildings, and so on.
                The third example, partition the set of all buildings into 2 classes – those in which you do have a class
                this semester and those in which you don’t. Every building in which you have a class is equivalent to
                every building in which you have a class (including itself), and every building in which you don’t
                have a class is equivalent to every building in which you don’t have a class.

             Let R be the relation on the set of all sets of real numbers such that S R T if and only if S and T have the
             same cardinality. Show that R is an equivalence relation. What are the equivalence classes of the sets {0,
             1, 2} and  Z ?
             Solution

                Two sets have the same cardinality if there is a bijection (1−1 and onto function) from one set to the
                other.
                We need to prove that R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
                Every set has the same cardinality as itself because of the identity function.

                If f is a bijection from S to T, then  f  − 1  is a bijection from T tot S, so R is symmetric.
                If f is a bijection from S to T, and g is a bijection from T to U, then  g f   is a bijection from S to U, so
                R is transitive.
                The equivalence class {1, 2, 3} is the set of all 3-element sets of real numbers, including such sets as
                                  (

          Solution

             a)  This relation is reflexive because each of 0, 1, 2, 3 is related to itself.
                 This relation is antisymmetric because a to be related to b is for a to be equal to b
                 Since a is related to b and b related to c and  abc= = , then a is related to c. So the relation is
                 transitive.
                 The equality relation on any set satisfies all three conditions, therefore is a partial ordering.

             b)  It is reflexive but it is not antisymmetric since we have  23R  and 32R  but  23.
                                                                                          ≠
                 Therefore, this is not a partial ordering.

             Solution

                a)  Since nobody is taller than himself, this relation is not reflexive, so (S, R) is not a poset.


                b)  To be not a taller means exactly the same height or shorter. 2 different people x and y could have
                    the same height, in which case  xRy and  yRx  but x ≠  y , so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                c)  The equality clause in the given of R guarantees that R is reflexive.
                    If a is ancestor to b, then b can’t be ancestor to a, so the relation is vacuously antisymmetric.
                    If a is ancestor to b and b is ancestor to c, then a is ancestor to c, thus R is transitive.
                    Therefore, this relation is a poset.
                d)  Let x and y be any 2 distinct friends,  xRy and  yRx  but x ≠  y , so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                e)  Let 2 people can be the same height since are not the same person, so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                f)  Since nobody is weight more than himself, this relation is not reflexive, so this relation is not a

          there is an edge associated to { ,u v  is a symmetric, irreflexive relation on G.
          Solution

             In a simple graph, edges are undirected.

             If uRv , then there is edge associated with { ,u v . But { ,u  v } { ,v u=  } , so this edge is associated with

             { ,v u  and, therefore. So, R is symmetric.
                                                                                              }
             A simple graph does not allow loops; that is if there is an edge associated with { ,u v , then u ≠ .

             Thus uRu  never holds, and so by definition R is irreflexive.

             Exercise

             Explain how graphs can be used to model electronic mail messages in a network. Should the edges be
             directed or undirected? Should multiple edges be allowed? Should loops be allowed? Describe a graph
             that models the electronic mail sent in a network in a particular week.

             Solution

                We can have a vertex for each mailbox or e-mail address in the network, with a directed edge between
                two vertices if a message is sent from the tail of the edge to the head.
                We use directed edge for each message sent during the week.

             Solution

                This graph has no Hamilton circuit.
                If it did, then certainly the circuit would have to contain edges {d, a} and {a, b}, since these are the
                only edges incident to vertex a. By the same reasoning, the circuit would have to contain the other six
                edges around the outside of the figure. These 8 edges already complete a circuit, and this circuit omits
                the 9 vertices on the inside.
                Therefore, there is no Hamilton circuit.

                  ABDCA         30 + 35 + 25 + 50 = 140

                  ACBDA         50 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 155
                  ACDBA         50 + 25 + 35 + 30 = 140
                  ADBCA         40 + 35 + 30 + 50 = 155
                  ADCBA         40 + 25 + 30 + 30 = 125

             Thus either route ABCDA or ADCBA fives the minimum total distance of 125 km.
