             Definition

             Let A and B be sets. A binary relation from A to B is a subset of  AB×
             A binary relation from A to B is a set R of ordered pairs where the first element of each ordered pair
             comes from A and the second element comes from B.
                                                                                              )
                                                          )
             We use the notation     Rb  to denote that ( ,a b ∈  and   aR  b  to denote that ( , a b ∉ . Moreover,
                                 a
                                                                                                 R
                                                             R
                        )
             when ( ,a b  belongs to R, a is said to be related to b by R.

             Let  A = {0, 1, 2  and  B = { , ab . Then  ( { 0, a   ) (1,    a   )}
             This means, for instance, that 0Ra  but the 1Rb / .
              Relations can be represented graphically, as shown below, using arrows to represent ordered pairs.










             Another way to represent this relation is to use a table.

             How many relations are there on a set with n elements?

             Solution

                                                                             2
                A relation on a set A is a subset of  AA× . Because  AA×  has  n  elements when A has n elements,
                                               m
                and a set with m elements has  2 subsets, there are  2 n 2   subset of  AA× .

                Thus there are  2 n 2  relations on a set with n elements.

             Example
             Is the “divides” relation on the set of positive integers transitive?
             Solution
                Suppose a divides b and b divides c. Then there are positive integers m and n such that b = ma  and
                c =  nb  . Hence  c =  ( n ma ) (nm a=  ) , so a divides c.

                Therefore this relation is transitive.

             Relations Using Diagraphs

             Definition

             A directed graph, or diagraph, consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) together with a set E ordered
             pairs of elements of V called edges (or arcs). The vertex a is called the initial vertex of the edge (a, b),
             and the vertex b is called the terminal vertex of this edge.

             Theorem

             Let R be a relation on a set A. There is a path of length n, where n is a positive integer, from a to b if

                            )
             and only if ( , a b ∈ R

             Proof

              Using mathematical induction
                                                                       )
              There is a path from a to b of length one if and only if ( ,a b ∈ , which is true when n = 1.
                                                                           R
              Assume that the theorem is true for a positive integer n.
                                                                                             A
              We need to prove that there is a path of length n + 1 from a to b if and only if c∈  such there is a
                                                                                                n
                                                                                            )

              path of length 1 from a to c, so ( ,ac ∈ R , and  path of length n from c to b ( ,cb ∈ R .
              Consequently, by the inductive hypothesis, there is a path of length n + 1 from a to b if and only if
                                                               n

                                                           )
              there is an element c with ( ,ac ∈ R  and ( ,cb ∈  R . But there is such an element iff ( ,a b ∈ R n+ 1 .
                                                                         )
              Therefore, there is a path of length n + 1 from a to b iff ( ,a b ∈ R n+ 1 . This completes the proof.

             Definition
             A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.


             Definition

                                                                                                              b
             Two elements a and b that related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The notation  a 
             is often used to denotes that a and b are equivalent elements with respect to a particular equivalence
             relation.


             Example


             Let R be the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if a = b or a = −b. It follows that R
             is an equivalence relation.


             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of real numbers such that aRb if and only if a −b is an integer.
             Is R an equivalence relation?
             Solution

                Because a – a = 0 is an integer for all real numbers a, aRa for all real numbers a. Hence, R is
                reflexive
                Suppose that aRb, then a – b is an integer, so b – a and b – c are integers.

                Therefore, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is also an integer. Hence, aRc.

                Thus, R is transitive. Consequently, R is an equivalence relation.


             Example

             Let m be an integer with m > 1.
              Show that the relation  R =  ( { ,a  b ) |   a ≡  b  (mod  m  } )  is an equivalence relation on the set of integers.

             Solution

                a ≡  b  (mod  m )  iff m divides a – b.

                Since 0 =  0 m⋅   then a – a = 0 is divisible by m. Hence,  a ≡  a  (mod  m ), so congruence modulo m
                is reflexive.
                Suppose that  a ≡ b  (mod  m ) , then a – b is divisible by m, so a – b = km, where k is an integer.

                It follows that   – b  a =   ( km−  ) , so b ≡  a  (mod  m ) . Hence, congruence modulo m is symmetric.

             same.
             That is, a string of fewer than n characters is related only to itself; a string s with at least n characters is
             related to a string t if and only if t has at least n characters and t begins with the n characters at the start
             of s.
             For example, let n = 3 and let S be the set of all bit strings.
             Then  s R t  either when s = t or both s and t are bit strings of length 3 or more that begin with the

             Solution

                The relation  R  is reflexive because s = s, so that  s R s  whenever s is a string in S.
                              n                                     n
                If  s Rt , then either s = t or s and t are both at least n characters long that begin with same n

                n characters long s and u begin with same n characters.

                Because s, t and u are all at least n characters long s and u begin with same n characters as t does.

             Equivalence Classes

             Definition

             Let R be an equivalent relation on a set A. The set of all elements that are related to an element a of A

             is called the equivalence class of a. The equivalence class of a with respect to R is denoted by [ ] a  .
                                                                                                           R
             When only one relation is under consideration, we can delete the subscript R and write [a] for this
             equivalence class.

                       R
                    b∈ [ ] a  , then b called a representative of this equivalence class.

             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if a = b or a = −b.
             What is the equivalence class for this relation?

             Solution
                Because an integer is equivalent to itself and its negative in this equivalence relation, it follows that
                [ ] { a a= −  ,  } .
                 a
                This set contains two distinct integers unless  a = .

             Example

             What is the equivalence class of 0 and 1 for congruence modulo 4?

             Solution

                The equivalence class of 0 contains all integers a such that  a  ≡  ( 0 mod  ) 4 . The integers in this
                class are those divisible by 4, Hence, the equivalence class of 0 for this relation is

                    [ ] 0   =    { ,  −  8,  −  4, 0, 4, 8,        }

                The equivalence class of 1 contains all integers a such that  a  ≡  ( 1 mod  ) 4 . The integers in this class

                are those that have a remainder of 1when divided by 4, Hence, the equivalence class of 1 for this
                relation is

                    [ ] 1   =  {     ,    −  7,  −  3, 1,5,9,         }

             Definition

             A relation R on set S is called a partial ordering or partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and
             transitive. A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a partially ordered set, or poset, and is
             denoted by (S, R). Members of S are called elements of the poset.


             Example

             Show that the “greater than or equal” relation ( ) ≥  is a partial ordering on the set of integers
             Solution

                Because  a ≥   for every integer a, ≥ is reflexive.
                             a
                                            b
                If  a ≥  and b ≥ , then  a = . Hence, ≥ is symmetric.
                      b
                                 a

                                                  c
                If  a ≥  and b ≥  imply that  a ≥ . Hence, ≥ is transitive.
                      b
                It follows that  ( ) ≥  is a partial ordering on the set of integers and ( ,  ≥  )  is a poset.


             Example
             Show that the inclusion relation ⊆ is a partial ordering on the power set of a set S.

             Solution

                Because  A ⊆  A whenever is a subset of S. ⊆ is reflexive.
                It is antisymmetric because  A ⊆  B  and  B ⊆  A imply that A =  B
                 A ⊆  B  and  B ⊆  C  imply that A ⊆ C , Hence ⊆ is transitive.
                                                            (

                Hence,  ⊆ is a partial ordering on  ( )  and  ( ),PS   ⊆  is a poset.

             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of people such that  xRy  if x and y are people and x is older than y.
             Show that is not a partial ordering,

             Solution

                 R is not reflexive, because no person is older than herself or himself  xRx
                 R is antisymmetric because if a person x is older than y, then y is not older than x. That is xRy ,
                 then  yRx .

                 The relation is transitive because a person x is older than y, then y is older than z, then x is older
                 than z.
                 R is not a partial ordering.

             Maximal and Minimal Elements
             An element of a poset is called maximal if it is not less than any element of the poset. That is, a is

             maximal in the poset ( ,S    if there is no element b∈  such that  a  .

             Similarly, an element of a poset is called minimal if it is not greater than any element of the poset. That
                                              )

             Maximal and minimal elements are easy to spot using a Hasse diagram. They are the “top” and
             “bottom” elements in the diagram.

             Sometimes there is an element in a poset that is greater than every other element. Such that an element

             A partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest
             lower bound is called a lattice. Lattices have many special properties.


             Example

             Determine whether the posets represented by each of the Hasse diagrams are lattices

















                                  (a)                       (b)                        (c)
             Solution

                The posets represented by the Hasse diagrams in (a) and (c) are both lattices because in each poset
                every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.
                On the other hand, the poset with the Hasse diagram shown in (b) is not a lattice, because the
                elements b and c have no least upper bound.
                Each of the elements d, e, and f is an upper bound, but none of these 3 elements precedes the other
                two with respect to the ordering of this poset.

                        (  +   )
             Is the poset    , |  a lattice?

             Solution
                Let a and b be two positive integers, The least upper bound and greatest lower bound of these 2
                integers are the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor of these integers,
                respectively, as the reader should verify. It follows that this is a lattice.

                Every elements of the second poset have both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. The
                least upper bound of 2 elements in this poset is the larger of the elements and the greatest lower
                bound of 2 elements is the smaller of the elements. Hence, the second poset is a lattice.

             Definition

                          V E
             A graph G = ( ,   )   consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices (or nodes) and E, a set of edges. Each
             edge has either one or two vertices (plural of vertex) associated with it, called its endpoints. An edge is
             said to connect its endpoints.
             Visualize the graphs by using points to represent vertices and line segments, possibly curved, to
             represent edges, where the endpoints of a line segment representing an edge are the points representing
             the edge-endpoints.















             To model a computer network, we need graphs that have more than one edge connecting the same pair
             of vertices. Graphs that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices are called multigraphs.

             Sometimes a communications link connects a data center with itself, a feedback loop for diagnostic
             purposes. Such edges are called loops.
             Graphs that may include loops, and possibly multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices or a
             vertex to itself, are sometimes called pseudographs.
             Sometimes we have a one-way communication link like

             Definition

             Two vertices u and v in an undirected graph G are called adjacent (or neighbors) in G if u and v are
             endpoints of an edge e of G. Such an edge e is called incident with the vertices u and v and e is said to
             connect u and v.

             A directed graph (or digraph) (V, E) consists of a nonempty set of vertices V and a set of directed
             edges (or arcs) E. Each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. The directed edge

             associated with the ordered pair (u, v) is said to start at u and end at v.

             Example

             Is it possible in a group of 9 people for each to be friends with exactly five others?

             Solution
                Imagine constructing an “acquaintance graph” in which each of the nine people represented by a
                vertex and 2 vertices are joined by an edge if, and only if, the people they represent are friends.

                Suppose each of the people were friends with exactly five others. Then the degree of each of the 9
                vertices of the graph would be 5, and so the total degree of the graph would be 45 (odd).
                Contradicts Corollary, which says that the total degree of a graph is even.
                Therefore, the answer is no.

             Sometimes, two graphs have exactly the same form, in the sense that there is a one-to-one
             correspondence between their vertex sets that preserves edges. In such case, we say that the two graphs
             are isomorphic.

             Sometimes it is not hard to show that two graphs are not isomorphic. In Particular, we can show that
             two graphs are not isomorphic if we can find a property only one of the two graphs has, but that is
             preserved by isomorphism. A property preserved by isomorphism of graphs is called a graph
             invariant.


             Example

             Show that the graphs shown below are not isomorphic

             Solution
                Both graphs G & H have 5 vertices and 6 edges.
                H has a vertex of degree one, @ e, whereas G has no vertices of degree one.
                It follows that G & H are not isomorphic.

                However, each of these four vertices in H is adjacent to another vertex of degree 2 in H, which is
                not true for a in G. Therefore, G & H are not isomorphic.
                Another way to see that G & H are not isomorphic is by checking the subgraphs of G & H  shown

             Paths

             A path is a sequence of edges that begins at a vertex of a graph and travels from vertex to vertex along
             edges of the graph.


             Definitions

             Let G be a graph, and let v and w be vertices in G.

             A walk from v to w is a finite alternating sequence of adjacent vertices and edges of G. Thus a walk
             has the form
                           v ev e      v   e v
                            0 11 2       n− 1 nn
                Where the v’s represent vertices, the e’s represents edges,  v =  , v v =  w and for all i = 1, 2,  …,
                                                                          0      n
                n, v    and v  are the endpoints of e .
                    i− 1     i                      i

                The trivial walk from v to v consists of the single vertex v.

             A trail from v to w is a walk from v to w that does not contain a repeated edge.

             A closed walk is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex.

             A circuit is a closed walk that contains at least one edge and does not contain a repeated edge.

             A simple circuit is a circuit that does not any other repeated vertex except first and last.

                    but not a path.
                b)  This is just a walk from v  to v . It is not a trail because it has a repeated edge.

                c)  This walk starts and ends at v , contains at least one edge, and does not have a repeated edge,

                    so it is a circuit. Since the vertex  v  is repeated in the middle, it is not a simple circuit.

                f)  The first vertex of this walk is the same as its last vertex, but it does not contain an edge, and so

             edges.
             However, d, e, c, a is not a path, because {e, c} is not an edge.
             Note that b, c, f, e, b is a circuit of length 4 because {b, c}, {c, f}, {f, e}, and {e, b} are edges, and this
             path begins and ends at b.

             The path a, b, e, d, a, b, which is of length 5, is not simple because it contains the edge {a, b} twice.

             Definition

             Let G be a graph. Two vertices v and w of G are connected if, and only if, there is a walk from v to w.

             The graph G is connected if, and only if, given any two vertices v and w in G, there is a walk from v to
             w. Symbolically,
                           G is connected   ⇔∀      vertices v , w  V∈  ( ),G ∃  a walk from v to w .


             Definition

             An undirected graph is called connected if there is a path between every pair of distinct vertices of the
             graph. An undirected graph that is not connected is called disconnected. We say that we disconnect a
             graph when we remove vertices or edges, or both, to produce a disconnected subgraph.

                The graph represented in (a) is connected, whereas those of (b) and (c) are not.
                To understand why (c) is not connected, two edges may cross at a point that is not a vertex.

                Thus the graph in (c) can be drawn as follows:

             The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler solved this problem.
             His solution, published in 1736, may be the first use of graph theory.

             Euler studied this problem using the multigraph obtained when the four regions are represented by
             vertices and the bridges by edges.



             Definition

             Let G be a graph. An Euler Circuit for G is a circuit that contains every vertex and every edge of G.
             That is, an Euler circuit for G is a sequence of adjacent vertices and edges in G that has at least one
             edge, starts and ends at the same vertex, uses every vertex of G at least once, and uses every edge of G
             exactly once.



             Theorem
             A connected multigraph with at least two vertices has an Euler circuit if and only if each of its vertices
             has even degree.



             Theorem

             A connected multigraph has Euler path but not an Euler circuit if and only if it has exactly 2 vertices of
             odd degree.

             Show that the graph below does not have an Euler circuit
















             Solution

                Vertices  v  & v  both have degree 3, which is odd. Hence by the contrapositive form, this graph
                          1    3
                does not have an Euler circuit.


             Definition

             Let G be a graph, and let v and w be two distinct vertices of G. An Euler trail from v to w is a sequence
             of adjacent edges and vertices that starts at v, ends at w, passes through every vertex of G at least once,
             and traverses every edge of G exactly once.


             Example

             Many puzzles ask you to draw a picture in a continuous motion without lifting a pencil so that no part
             of the picture is retraced. We can solve such puzzles using Euler circuits and paths. For example, can
             Mohammed’s scimitars, shown in Figure below, be drawn in this way, where the drawing begins and
             ends at the same point?















             Solution

                Let denote G for the graph. G has an Euler circuit, because all its vertices have even degree.
                1.  Form the circuit: a, b, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. We obtain the subgraph H by deleting the edges in this
                    circuit and all vertices that become isolated when these edges are removed.
                2.  Form: d, g, h, j, i, h, k, g, f, d in H. After forming this circuit we have used all edges in G.
                    Splicing this new circuit into the first circuit at the appropriate place produces the Euler circuit
                    a, b, d, g, h, j, i, h, k, g, f, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. This circuit gives a way to draw the scimitars
                    without lifting the pencil or retracting part of the picture.
