             Example

             How many relations are there on a set with n elements?

             Solution

                                                                              2
                A relation on a set A is a subset of  A   A . Because  A   A  has  n  elements when A has n elements,
                                               m
                and a set with m elements has  2 subsets, there are  2 n 2   subset of  A   A .
                Thus there are  2 n 2 relations on a set with n elements.

              Which of these relations are reflexive?
             Solution
                The relations  R and  R  are reflexive because they contain all pairs of the form (a, a), namely,  (1,

                1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4).
                 R  , R  , R  , and  R  are not reflexive because (3, 3) is not in any of these relations.

             Example
             Is the “divides” relation on the set of positive integers transitive?
             Solution
                Suppose a divides b and b divides c. Then there are positive integers m and n such that b   ma  and
                                                
                c   nb  . Hence  c    n ma    nm a , so a divides c.
                Therefore this relation is transitive.

             The relation on a set A is transitive iff  R   R  for n = 1, 2, 3, .

             Proof

                                                                       2
                               n
                Suppose that  R   R  for n = 1, 2, 3, . In particular,  R   R . If  b      b,   R , then
                                                                                      R  and  c

                                                                  2
                                                
                by definition of composite,  , a  c   R . Because  R   R , this means that  c 
                                                                                          a   ,

                transitive.
                Using mathematical induction to prove the only if part of the theorem
                               n
                Assume that  R    R  where n is a positive integer. This is the inductive hypothesis.
                To complete the inductive step we must show that this implies that  R n  1  is also a subset of R.

                that  xa  ,   R   and  , x  b  R . The inductive hypothesis, namely, that  R   R , implies that

                                                             
                                                                                                      

                Furthermore, because R is transitive, and  ,a  x   and  ,x  b  , it follows that  ,a  b  .
                                  n
                This shows that  R   R .

             Relations Using Diagraphs

             Definition

             A directed graph, or diagraph, consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) together with a set E ordered
             pairs of elements of V called edges (or arcs). The vertex a is called the initial vertex of the edge (a, b),
             and the vertex b is called the terminal vertex of this edge.

             Definition

             A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

             Definition


             Two elements a and b that related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The notation  a  b
             is often used to denotes that a and b are equivalent elements with respect to a particular equivalence
             relation.



             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if a = b or a = b. It follows that R
             is an equivalence relation.


             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of real numbers such that aRb if and only if a b is an integer . Is R an
             equivalence relation?

             Solution
                Because a – a = 0 is an integer for all real numbers a, aRa for all real numbers a. Hence, R is
                reflexive
                Suppose that aRb, then a – b is an integer, so b – a and b – c are integers.
                Therefore, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is also an integer. Hence, aRc.
                Thus, R is transitive. Consequently, R is an equivalence relation.


             Example


             Let m be an integer with m > 1. Show that the relation  R     a  b  | a   b  (mod  m   )  is an equivalence
                                                                         ,
             relation on the set of integers.
             Solution

                a   b  (mod  m ) iff m divides a – b.
                Since  0   0 m   then a – a = 0 is divisible by m. Hence,  a   a  (mod  m ) , so congruence modulo m
                is reflexive.
                Suppose that  a  b  (mod  m ), then a – b is divisible by m, so a – b = km, where k is an integer. It

                follows that b – a = (k)m, so b   a  (mod  m ). Hence, congruence modulo m is symmetric.
                Suppose that  a  b  (mod  m ) and b  c  (mod  m ), then m divides both a – b and b – c. so
                a   b   km  and b   c   lm , where k and l are integers. It follows that

             Show that every set S of strings and every positive integer n,  R  is an equivalence relation on S.

             Solution

                The relation  R  is reflexive because s = s, so that  s R s  whenever s is a string in S.
                              n                                     n
                If  s R t , then either s = t or s and t are both at least n characters long that begin with same n
                      n
                characters. This means that  t R s . Therefore,  R is symmetric.
                                              n                n
                Suppose that  s R t  and t R u . Then either s = t or s and t are both at least n characters long s and t
                                 n         n
                begin with same n characters, and either t = u or t and u are both at least n characters long t and u
                begin with same n characters. From this, we can deduce that either s = u or s and u are both at least
                n characters long s and u begin with same n characters.
                Because s, t and u are all at least n characters long s and u begin with same n characters as t does.
                Therefore,  R is transitive.
                             n
                It follows that  R  is an equivalence relation.

             Example
             Let R be the relation on the set of real numbers such that  x R y  if and only if x and y are real numbers
             that differ by less than 1, that is  x   y   1. Show that R is not an equivalence relation.

             Definition
             Let R be an equivalent relation on a set A. The set of all elements that are related to an element a of A
             is called the equivalence class of a. The equivalence class of a with respect to R is denoted by    .
                                                                                                         a
                                                                                                           R
             When only one relation is under consideration, we can delete the subscript R and write [a] for this
             equivalence class.

             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if a = b or a = b. What is the
             equivalence class for this relation?

             Solution

                Because an integer is equivalent to itself and its negative in this equivalence relation, it follows that
                            
                   a  a . This set contains two distinct integers unless  a  .

             Example
             What is the equivalence class of 0 and 1 for congruence modulo 4?
             Solution
                The equivalence class of 0 contains all integers a such that  a    0 mod  4  . The integers in this
                class are those divisible by 4, Hence, the equivalence class of 0 for this relation is
                    [0] = {, 8, 4, 0, 4, 8, }

                The equivalence class of 1 contains all integers a such that  a     1 mod  4  . The integers in this
                class are those that have a remainder of 1when divided by 4, Hence, the equivalence class of 1 for
                this relation is
                    [1] = {, 7, 3, 1, 5, 9, }

             Definition

             A relation R on set S is called a partial ordering or partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and
             transitive. A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a partially ordered set, or poset, and is
             denoted by (S, R). Members of S are called elements of the poset.


             Example

             Show that the “greater than or equal” relation     is a partial ordering on the set of integers
                                                          
             Solution

                Because  a   a   for every integer a,  is reflexive.

                If  a   and  b   a , then  a  . Hence,  is symmetric.
                                             b
                       b
                If  a   and  b   imply that   a  . Hence,  is transitive.
                                 c

                It follows that      is a partial ordering on the set of integers and   ,    is a poset.
                                


             Example
             Show that the inclusion relation    is a partial ordering on the power set of a set S.
             Solution

                Because  A   A whenever is a subset of S.   is reflexive.
                It is antisymmetric because  A   B  and  B   A imply that A   B

                 A  B  and  B   C  imply that A  C , Hence    is transitive.
                                                                      

             Example

             Let R be the relation on the set of people such that  xRy  if x and y are people and x is older than y.
             Show that is not a partial ordering,
             Solution

                 R is not reflexive, because no person is older than herself or himself  xRx
                 R is antisymmetric because if a person x is older than y, then y is not older than x. That is xRy ,

                 then  yRx .
                 The relation is transitive because a person x is older than y, then y is older than z, then x is older
                 than z.
                 R is not a partial ordering.

             Maximal and minimal elements are easy to spot using a Hasse diagram. They are the “top” and

             Sometimes there is an element in a poset that is greater than every other element. Such that an element

                There is no upper bounds of {j, h}, and its lower bounds are a, b, c, d, e,
                and f.
                The upper bounds of {a, c, d, f} are f, h, and j, and its lower bound is a.


             Lattices

             A partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest
             lower bound is called a lattice. Lattices have many special properties.


             Example

             Determine whether the posets represented by each of the Hasse diagrams are lattices















                                     (a)                    (b)                     (c)
             Solution

                The posets represented by the Hasse diagrams in (a) and (c) are both lattices because in each poset
                every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.
                On the other hand, the poset with the Hasse diagram shown in (b) is not a lattice, because the
                elements b and c have no least upper bound. Each of the elements d, e, and f is an upper bound, but
                none of these 3 elements precedes the other two with respect to the ordering of this poset.


             Example
                             
             Is the poset    ,  |  a lattice?
             Solution

                Let a and b be two positive integers, The least upper bound and greatest lower bound of these 2
                integers are the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor of these integers,
                respectively, as the reader should verify. It follows that this is a lattice.

             said to connect its endpoints.
             Visualize the graphs by using points to represent vertices and line segments, possibly curved, to
             represent edges, where the endpoints of a line segment representing an edge are the points representing
             the edge-endpoints.

             To model a computer network, we need graphs that have more than one edge connecting the same pair
             of vertices. Graphs that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices are called multigraphs.
             Sometimes a communications link connects a data center with itself, a feedback loop for diagnostic
             purposes. Such edges are called loops.

             Graphs that may include loops, and possibly multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices or a
             vertex to itself, are sometimes called pseudographs.

                c)  There is no simple graph with four vertices of degrees 1, 1, 3, and 3.


             Example

             Is it possible in a group of 9 people for each to be friends with exactly five others?
             Solution

                Imagine constructing an “acquaintance graph” in which each of the nine people represented by a
                vertex and 2 vertices are joined by an edge if, and only if, the people they represent are friends.
                Suppose each of the people were friends with exactly five others. Then the degree of each of the 9
                vertices of the graph would be 5, and so the total degree of the graph would be 45 (odd).
                Contradicts Corollary, which says that the total degree of a graph is even.

             A tournament where each team plays every other team exactly once and no ties are allowed is called a
             round-robin tournament. Such tournaments can be modeled using directed graphs where each team is
             represented by a vertex, Note that (a, b) is an edge if team a beats team b. This graph is a simple
             directed graph, containing no loops or multiple directed edges (because no 2 teams play each other
             more than once. Such a directed graph model is presented


















               We see that team 1 is undefeated in this tournament, and Team 3 is winless.

             Sometimes it is not hard to show that two graphs are not isomorphic. In Particular, we can show that
             two graphs are not isomorphic if we can find a property only one of the two graphs has, but that is
             preserved by isomorphism. A property preserved by isomorphism of graphs is called a graph
             invariant.


             Example
             Show that the graphs shown below are not isomorphic

             Solution
                Both graphs G & H have 5 vertices and 6 edges.
                H has a vertex of degree one, @ e, whereas G has no vertices of degree one.
                It follows that G & H are not isomorphic.

             Solution

                Both graphs G & H have 8 vertices and 10 edges.
                Also both have 4 vertices of degree 2 and 4 vertices of degree 3.

                H, which is not true for a in G. Therefore, G & H are not isomorphic.

             Solution
                a)  This walk has a repeated vertex but does not have a repeated edge, so it is a trail from  v  to v
                                                                                                        1    4
                    but not a path.
                b)  This is just a walk from v  to v . It is not a trail because it has a repeated edge.
                                            1     5
                c)  This walk starts and ends at  v , contains at least one edge, and does not have a repeated edge,
                                                2
                    so it is a circuit. Since the vertex  v  is repeated in the middle, it is not a simple circuit.
                                                     3
                d)  This walk starts and ends at  v , contains at least one edge, and does not have a repeated edge,
                                                2
                    and does not have a repeated vertex. Thus it is a simple circuit.
                e)  This is just a closed walk starting and ending at  v . It is not a circuit because edge  e  is
                                                                   1                                 1
                    repeated.
                f)  The first vertex of this walk is the same as its last vertex, but it does not contain an edge, and so
                    it is not a circuit, It is a closed walk from  v  to v . (It is also a trail from  v  to v )

             Definition

             An undirected graph is called connected if there is a path between every pair of distinct vertices of the
             graph. An undirected graph that is not connected is called disconnected. We say that we disconnect a
             graph when we remove vertices or edges, or both, to produce a disconnected subgraph.

             The town of  Konigsberg  was divided into 4 sections by the branches of the Pregel River. The town
             people took long walks through town. They wondered whether it was possible to start at some location
             in the town, travel across all the bridges once without crossing and bridge twice, and return to the
             starting point.

             The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler solved this problem. His solution, published in 1736, may be
             the first use of graph theory. Euler studied this problem using the multigraph obtained when the four
             regions are represented by vertices and the bridges by edges.


             Definition

             Let G be a graph. An Euler Circuit for G is a circuit that contains every vertex and every edge of G.
             That is, an Euler circuit for G is a sequence of adjacent vertices and edges in G that has at least one
             edge, starts and ends at the same vertex, uses every vertex of G at least once, and uses every edge of G
             exactly once.



             Theorem

             A connected multigraph with at least two vertices has an Euler circuit if and only if each of its vertices
             has even degree.


             Theorem

             A connected multigraph has Euler path but not an Euler circuit if and only if it has exactly 2 vertices of
             odd degree.

             Definition

             Let G be a graph, and let v and w be two distinct vertices of G. An Euler trail from v to w is a sequence
             of adjacent edges and vertices that starts at v, ends at w, passes through every vertex of G at least once,
             and traverses every edge of G exactly once.


             Example

             Many puzzles ask you to draw a picture in a continuous motion without lifting a pencil so that no part
             of the picture is retraced. We can solve such puzzles using Euler circuits and paths. For example, can
             Mohammed’s scimitars, shown in Figure below, be drawn in this way, where the drawing begins and
             ends at the same point?











             Solution

                Let denote G for the graph. G has an Euler circuit, because all its vertices have even degree.
                1.  Form the circuit: a, b, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. We obtain the subgraph H by deleting the edges in this
                    circuit and all vertices that become isolated when these edges are removed.
                2.  Form: d, g, h, j, i, h, k, g, f, d in H. After forming this circuit we have used all edges in G.
                    Splicing this new circuit into the first circuit at the appropriate place produces the Euler circuit
                    a, b, d, g, h, j, i, h, k, g, f, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. This circuit gives a way to draw the scimitars
                    without lifting the pencil or retracting part of the picture.
