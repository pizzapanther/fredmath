Let the segment EF passes through the point B such that:                                                       FBC =  90°  45                                            °                                        =                     EBA =                                    2                                                             90°−  BAC                     EAB =                                                               39","= 90°− 67.5°                         =  22.5                              °                        180°−  EBA BAE                                                                                         AEB =                                     −                        = 180°− 45°−  22.5°                        = 112.5                               °                                                 ACB                  BCF =  90°−                          = 90°− 22.5°                        =  67.5                              °                        180°−        BCF                                                                       FBC −                  BFC =                        = 180°− 45°−  67.5°                        =  67.5                              °                                                                                                                         40","Exercise  33               Given an isosceles triangle ABC with a peak at A with angle of  47°.               The height of a triangle ABC of each of the three lines passing through a vertex of the triangle and               perpendicular to the opposite side to this vertex, are AM, BN, CP.              What is the angle of the peak of the isosceles triangle MNP ?               Solution                 The triangle ABC is isosceles triangle at A then the height AM is the bisector. So, the point M is the                 middle point of the side BC.                                   Since the 2 right triangles BPC \& BNC have the same hypothesis segment BC.                 There are inscribed in a circle with diameter BC with the center at point M.                 Therefore, the triangle MNP is isosceles with a peak at the point M.                                                                         C =  MNC =   B =  BPM                                      BMP = 180°−  2B                                                         CMN = 180°−  2C                   B = 180°− 47°                          2                   =  133°                       2                         180°−      −                                  BMP CMN                  PMN =                        = 180°− 180°+  2B − 180°+ 2B                        =  4B −  180                                  °                            133°                        =  4 ( )  −  180°                              2                        = 266°− 180°                        = 86                            °                                                                        41"];
