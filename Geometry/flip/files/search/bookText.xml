          In a triangle ABC, the medians segment BM and CN intersect in right angles and the measurement are 3

             the segments AD and PD. Calculate AD and DP.
          3.  What is the natural of the triangle APD ?
          Solution

             1.  Since M and N are the middle point of the sides AC & AB, then
                 BG =  2  BM
                       3

                      =  2 ( ) 3
                        3
                      =  2   units

                 Similar,

                 CG =  2 CN
                       3

                      =  2 ( ) 6
                        3
                      =  4   units

                 Wish, we lead to: GM =  1  & GN =    2

                 We can construct 2 perpendicular lines intersect at a point G, then we use to measure the distance
                 from the point G to get the points B, C, M, & N.
                 By extending the segment BN and CM with equal distance and which it will intersect at point A.


             2.  Since  ND  BC  &  MD =   MN
                 The parallelogram BPDM,  BP =   MD =  MN
                 Then  PD =  MB = 3  units

                 AD   CN  and M is the intersection of the diagonals of the parallelogram ADCN, then

                 AD CN=    =  6  units

             3.  PD   BN    & MB ⊥    CN , then  PD ⊥  CN

                 AD   CN    & PD ⊥    CN , then  AD ⊥  PD

                 Therefore; the triangle ADP is right triangle at point D.
