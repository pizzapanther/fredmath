Intuitively it appears that y is close to 7 when x is close to                                                     4                                                 0                     (                                                              4           4, so  lim 2x −  ) 1 =  7 . However, how close to  x =  does x have to be so that  y = 2x − 1 differs from 7                x→  4                                     0           by, say less than 2 units?

A woman plans to row the boat straight to a point on the shore and then                   walk along the shore to the restaurant.                                   a)  If she walks at 3 mi/hr and rows at 2 mi/hr, at which point on the shore should she land to                       minimize the total travel time?                   b)  If she walks at 3 mi/hr what is the minimum speed at which she must row so that the quickest                       way to the restaurant is to row directly (with no walking)?                76.  A cone is constructed by cutting a sector of angle θ from a circular sheet of metal with radius 20 cm.                   the cut sheet is then folded up and wheeled. What angle θ maximizes the volume of the cone?                                Find the radius and height of the cone with maximum volume that can be formed in this way.               77.  Several mathematical stories originated with the second wedding                   of the mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler. Here is                   one: while shopping for wine for his wedding, Kepler noticed                   that the price of a barrel of wine (here assumed to be a cylinder)                   was determined solely by the length d of a dipstick that was                   inserted diagonally through a hole in the top of the barrel to the                   edge of the base of the barrel.                   Kepler realized that this measurement does not determine the                   volume of the barrel and that for a fixed value of d, the volume                    varies the radius r and height h of the barrel. For a fixed value of                   d, what is the ratio r/h that maximizes the volume of the barrel?                                                                 203","78.  A load must be suspended 6 m below a high ceiling using cables attached to two supports that are 2                m apart.                                      How far below the ceiling (x) should the cables be joined to minimize the total length of cable used?            79.  An island is 3.5 mi from the nearest point on a straight shoreline; that point is 8 mi from a power                station. A utility company plans to lay electrical cable underwater from the island to the shore and                then underground along the shore to the power station. Assume that is costs $2,400/mi to lay                underwater cable and $1,200/mi to lay underground cable. At what point should the underwater                cable meet the shore in order to minimize the cost of the project?                           80.  A crank of radius r rotates with an angular frequency ω. It is connected to a piston by a connecting                rod of length L. the acceleration of the piston varies with the position of the crank according to the                function                                                    a ( ) θ  ω =  2 r ( cosθ  +  r cos2θ )                                                                          L                                For fixed ω  and r, find the values of θ, with 0 θ ≤  2π ≤  , for which the acceleration of the piston                  is a maximum and minimum.                                                             204","81.  A rain gutter is made from sheets of metal 9 in wide. The gutters have a 3-in base and two 3-in                   sides, folded up at an angle θ.                                         What angle θ maximizes the cross-sectional area of the gutter?                82.  Two poles of heights m and n are separated by a horizontal distance d. A rope is stretched from the                   top of one pole to the ground and then to the top of the other pole.

Fermat’s principle states that when light travels between two points in the same medium (at a                   constant speed), it travels on the path that minimizes the travel time.
