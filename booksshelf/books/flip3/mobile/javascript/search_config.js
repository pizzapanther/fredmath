We ignore the effects of any frictional              drag on the object, which may vary with its speed and altitude, and also the fact the force of gravity              changes slightly with the projectile’s changing height.               To derive equations for projectile motion, we assume that the projectile behaves like a particle moving in              a vertical coordinate plane and the only force acting on the projectile during its flight is the constant force              of gravity, which always points straight down.

The streams are following paths of           steepest descent so the waters reach lower elevation as quickly as possible. Therefore, the fastest           instantaneous rate of change in a stream’s elevation above the sea level has a particular direction.

It says                   that in a cylinder of radius R and length L, the velocity of the fluid  r ≤  R  units from the centerline                                                2                   of the cylinder is V =  P  ( R −  r 2 ) , where P is the difference in the pressure between the ends of                                        4Lυ                   the cylinder and υ  is  the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that P and υ  are constant, the velocity V                    along the centerline of the cylinder (r =  ) 0  is V =  kR 2  , where k is a constant that we will take to be                                                                     L                   k = 1.                                   a)  Estimate the change in the centerline velocity (r =  ) 0  if the radius of the flow cylinder                                                             c                        increases from  R = 3 m c  to  R =  3.05 m  and the length increases from  L =  50 m c  to                         L =  50.5 m .                                  c                                                                169","b)  Estimate the percent change in the centerline velocity if the radius of the flow cylinder R                     decreases by 1% and the length increases by 2%.                                                                     r           65.

Geographers measure the geographical center of a country (which is the centroid) and the population                center of a country (which is the center of mass computed with the population density).A                hypothetical country is shown below with the location and population of five towns.                                         Assuming no one lives outside the towns, find the geographical center of the country and the                population center of the country,            77.  A disk radius r is removed from a larger disk of radius R to from an earring.

They are represented by a vector,              in a subset of Euclidean space, at each point in their domain, producing a vector field.              Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout              space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it              changes from point to point. A line integral can be used to find the rate at which the fluid flows along or              across a curve within the domain.                Vector Fields                Suppose a region in the plane or in space occupied by a moving fluid, such air or water. The fluid is made              up of a large number of particles, where a particle has a velocity which can vary. Such a fluid flow is an              example of a vector field.               Vectors fields are associated with forces such as gravitational attraction, and to magnetic fields, electric              fields, and also purely mathematical fields.                                                                                                            333","A vector filed is a function that assigns a vector to each point in its domain.

It is the two-dimensional special case of the more           general Stokes' theorem, and is named after British mathematician George Green.
