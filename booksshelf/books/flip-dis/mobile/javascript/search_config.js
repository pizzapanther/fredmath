These rules are used to distinguish              between valid and invalid mathematical arguments.               The logic rules are used in the design of computer circuits, the construction of computer programs, and              the verification of the correctness of programs.                Propositions               A proposition is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false,              but not both.               All the following declarative sentences are propositions                   Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States of America.

Sentences 3 and 4 are not propositions because they are not true (T) or false (F).                Definition               Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by  p¬  (also denoted by  p ), is the statement                  “It is not the case that p.”              The proposition  p¬  is read “not p”. The truth value of the negation of p,  p¬ , is the opposite of the truth              value of p.                                                                   1","Example            Find the negation of the proposition:  “Michael’s PC runs Linux” and express this in simple English.

For this conjunction to be true, both conditions given must be true.

Express the statement  p →  as a statement in English.

There are many other way to express this conditional statement.                    Maria will find a good job when she learns discrete mathematics.                    For Maria to get a good job, it is sufficient for her to learn discrete mathematics.                    Maria will find a good job unless she does not learn discrete mathematics.

(The symbol := stands for assignment. The statement                 0               x             : x = + 1 means the assignment of the value of  x + 1 to x.)

Suppose that the computer MATH1 is           connected to network CAMPUS2, but not to network CAMPUS1.

If  ( ) x  is true for this value of x, the                                                                               P                                                      P                                                                         0                                                                                             P                                        x              assignment statement  :x = + 1 is executed. So the value of x is increased by 1. If  ( ) x  is false for              this value of x, the assignment statement is not executed, so the value of x is not changed.             Preconditions and Postconditions            Predicates are also used to establish the correctness of computer programs, that is, to show that computer           programs always produce desired output given valid input.           The statements that describe valid input are known as preconditions and the conditions that the output           should satisfy when the program has run are known as postconditions.             Quantifiers            To create a proposition from a propositional function is called quantification.  Quantification expresses           the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. The words all, some, many, none and few           are used in quantifications.           The area of logic that deals with predicates and quantifiers is called the predicate calculus.            There are two quantifiers                    Existential Quantifier    “∃” reads “there exists”                     Universal Quantifier      “∀” reads “for all”           Each is placed in front of a propositional function and binds it to obtain a proposition with semantic           value.                                                                  18","Definition                The universal quantification of  ( ) x  is the statement                                             P                     “ ( ) x  for all values of x in the domain.”                      P              The notation  x P x∀  ( )  denotes the universal quantification of  ( ) x . Here ∀ is called the universal                                                                          P                                                                               ( )                                      ( )                                                        ( )              quantifier.

Nested quantifiers can              sometimes be difficult to understand.              We will see how to use nested quantifiers to express mathematical statements such as “The sum of two              positive integers is always positive.” We will show how nested quantifiers can be used to translate              sentences such as “Everyone has exactly one best friend” into logical statements.                Example               Translate the statement  x y x∀∀  ( (  >  0 ) ( y∧  <  ) 0 → ( xy <  0 ))              Where the domain for both variables consists of all real numbers.               Solution                                                                                                          0                 This statement says that for every real number x and every real number y, if  x >  and  y < , then                                                                                              0                  xy <  0 . That is, this statement says that for all real numbers x and y, if x is positive and y is negative,                 then xy is negative.                 This can be stated more succinctly as                 “The product of a postitive real number and a negative real numer is always a negative real number.”                  The Order of Quantifiers               Example                          )                                                     +              Let  ( ,P x y  be the statement \"x y+=  yx \".

This                 illustrates the principle that the order of nested universal quantifiers in a statement without other                 quantifiers can be changed without changing the meaning of the quantified statement.                                                                  27","Example                                                                                                                )                      )           Let  ( ,P x y  be the statement \"x y+=  0\".

Theorems can also be referred to as facts or results.              We demonstrate that a theorem is true with a proof. A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth              of a theorem. The statements used in a proof can include axioms (or postulates), which are statements we              assume to be true.              Less important theorems sometimes are called propositions. A less important theorem that is helpful in              the proof of other results is called a lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata).               A corollary is a theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that has been proved.              A conjecture is a statement that is being proposed to be true statement, usually on the basis of some              partial evidence, a heuristic argument, or the intuition of an expert.                 Direct Proofs                                                           q              A direct proof is a conditional statement  p →  is constructed when the first step is the assumption that p              is true; subsequence steps are constructed using rules of inference, with the final step showing that q must              be true.                                           q              Consider an implication:  p →                 •  If p is false, then the implication is always true.                 •  Show that if p is true then q is true.                 Definition               The integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that  n =  2k , and n is odd if there exists an integer k              such that  n =  2k + 1. Two integers have the same parity when both are even or both are odd; they have              opposite parity when one is even and the other is odd.

By the definition of an odd integer, it                                                                                    2              follows that  n =  2k + 1, where k is some integer. We need to show that  n  is odd.                    2                  n =  (2k +  ) 1  2           Square both sides                       =  4k +  2  4k +  1                         (                      =  22k +  2  2k +  )  1    2k +  2  2k =  K                       =  2K + 1                                                                       2              By the definition of an odd integer, we can conclude that  n  is also an odd integer.              Example            Give a direct proof that if m and n are both perfect squares, then nm is also a perfect square.           (An integer a is a perfect square if there is an integer b such that  ab=  2 .)            Solution               Using direct proof of this theorem, we assume that the hypothesis of this conditional statement is true,              namely, we assume that m and n are both perfect squares.

Example               Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd.               Solution                  The first step in a proof by contraposition is to assume that the conclusion of the conditional statement                 “3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd” is false. Assume that n is even, then by the definition of an even integer,                  n =  2k for some integer k.                                              2                     3n +=    ( ) 2      6k +=    ( 23k +  ) 1                          2 3 2k +=                 This show 3n +  is even, because it is a multiple of 2, therefore not odd. This is the negation of the                                2                 theorem of the conditional statement implies that the hypothesis is false; the original conditional                 statement is true.                 Our proof by contraposition succeeded; we have proved the theorem “If 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd.”                 Example               Prove that if  n = ab  where a and b are positive integers, then  a ≤  n  or b ≤  n .

Suppose that ¬ p is true  ⇒ “ 2  is rational”.              If  2  is rational,  a and b∃  ∋  2 =  a                                                   b                  ( ) ( )     2   ⇒    2 =  a 2  →  2 b =  2  a                       2                            a                                                          2                         =                     2                                            2                            b                                          b                              2              It follows that  a  is even, that implies a must also be even. Therefore, by the definition of an even              integer then we can let  a = 2c  for some integer c. Thus,  2b =  2  4c 2  ⇒  b =  2  2c 2                                                         2              By the definition of even, this means that b  is even, that implies b must also be even as well.                                                               a              The assumption of ¬ p leads to the equation  2 =   ,  where a and b have no common factors, but                                                               b              both a and b are even, that is, 2 divides both a and b. However, our assumption ¬ p leads to the              contradiction that 2 divides both a and b and 2 doesn’t divide both a and b, ¬ p must be false.              That is, the statement p “ 2  is irrational” is true.                                                              40","Proofs of Equivalence                                                                                                     q              To prove a theorem that is a biconditional statement, that is, a statement of the form  p ↔ , we must                             q              show that  p →  and q →   p  are both true.

Mistakes in Proofs               Each step of a mathematical proof needs to be correct and the conclusion needs to follow logically from              the steps that precede it.

Generally, if the statement is a conditional statement,           we should try a direct proof; if this fails, we can try an indirect proof. If neither of these approaches           works, you might try a proof by contradiction.             Example             Given two positive numbers x and y, their arithmetic mean is    x +  y   and their geometric mean is  xy .                                                                         2           When we compare the arithmetic and geometric means of pairs of distinct positive real numbers, we find                                                                                                              6           that the arithmetic mean is always greater than the geometric mean. For example, when  x =  and  y = ,                                                                                                   4                     +           we have   46  = 5 >  4 6⋅=   24 .

A set is said to contain              its elements. We write  a∈  to denote that a is an element of the set A.

If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonegative integer, we say that S is              a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|.                  •  Let A be the set of odd positive integers less than 10.   |A| = 5                  •  Let S be the set of of letter in English alphabet.       |S| = 26                  •  The null set has no elements.                            |∅| = 0                Definition               A set is said to be infinite if it is not finite.

It is one-to-one because no two values in the domain are assigned the same function value.                 It is onto because all four elements of the codomain are images of elements in the domain.                 Hence, f is a bijection.

Solution               4 = 1 + 3              7 = 4 + 3              11 = 4 + 7              And so on. We can see that the third term is the sum of the two previous term.

Output: From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The                   output values are the solution to the problem.          Definiteness: The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.          Correctness: An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.            Finiteness: An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of                      steps for any input in the set.           Effectiveness: It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount                         of time.           Generality: The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a                       particular set of input values.

Solution                 The input to Algorithm 1 is a sequence of integers. The output is the largest integer in the sequence.                 Each step of the algorithm is precisely defined, because only assignments, a finite loop, and                 conditional statements occur.                 The values of the variable max equals the maximum terms when the algorithm terminates.                 The initial value of max is the first term; as successive terms of the sequence are examined. This                 argument shows that when all the terms have been examined, max equal the value of the largest                 term and it will take n steps.

Solution                  Two integers are added by successively adding pairs of bits. Adding each pair of bits and the carry                 requires two additions of bits. Thus, the total number of additions of bits used is less than twice the                 number of bits in the expansion. Hence, the number of additions of bits used by Algorithm 2 to add                 two n-bit integers is O(n).

A positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called composite.             Example           The integer 7 is prime because its only positive factors are 1 and 7.           The integer 9 is composite because its is divisible by 3.             Theorem − The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic            Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of two or more primes           where the prime factors are written in order of nondecreasing size.

Hence, by                                                                                                  n            the definition of a factor, we have  n =  ab , b ( positive integer ) 1> .             If a >  n   and   b >  n , then  ab >  n ⋅  n =  n, which is a contradiction. Consequently,              a ≤  n and b ≤   n . Because both a and b are divisors of n, we see that n has a positive divisor not            exceeding  n . This divisor is either prime or, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, has a prime             divisor less than itself. In either case, n has a prime divisor less than or equal to  n .                                                             114","Example               Show that 101 is prime               Solution                  The only primes not exceeding  101  are 2, 3, 5, 7. Because 101 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (the                 quotient of 101 and each of these integers is not an integer). It follows that 101 is prime.

For              example, begin with the list of integers between 1 and 100.               a.  Delete all  the integers, other than 2, divisible by 2.              b.

Next, delete all the integers, other than 7, divisible by 7.              e.  Since all the remaining integers  are not divisible by any of the previous integers, other than 1, the                 primes are:   {2,3,7,11,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89, 97}                 If an integer n is a composite integer, then it has a prime divisor less than or equal to  n .

Lemma 2               If a, b, and c are positive integers such that gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc, then a | c.               Proof               Assume gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc               Since gcd(a, b) = 1, by Bézout’s Theorem  there are integers s and t such that  sa + tb = 1.               Multiplying both sides of the equation by c, yields sac + tbc = c.   a | tbc and  a divides sac + tbc since               a | sac and a|tbc. We conclude a | c, since  sac + tbc = c.

A common hashing function is  h(k) = k mod m, where m is the number of memory locations. Because           this hashing function is onto, all memory locations are possible.             Example            Find the memory locations assigned by the hashing function h(k) = k mod 111 to the records of customers           with Social Security numbers 064212848, 037149212, and 107405723.            Solution               This hashing function  assigns the records of customers with social security numbers as keys to              memory locations in the following manner:                  h(064212848) = 064212848 mod 111 = 14                  h (037149212) = 037149212 mod 111 = 65                  h (107405723) = 107405723 mod 111 = 14,               But since location 14 is already occupied, the record is assigned to the next available position, which              is 15.              The hashing function is not one-to-one as there are many more possible keys than memory locations.           When more than one record is assigned to the same location, we say a collision occurs.  Here a collision           has been resolved by assigning the record to the first free location. For collision resolution, we can use a           linear probing function:                                                   ,                                      ( , i                                    hk    ) (hk  i  =  ( ) ) mod  m ,  where i from 0 to m – 1.           There are many other methods of handling with collisions. You may cover these in a later CS course.                                                                                 126","Pseudorandom Numbers               Randomly chosen numbers are needed for many purposes, including computer simulations.              Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random since they are generated by systematic methods.              The linear congruential method is one commonly used procedure for generating pseudorandom numbers.                                                                                                            a              Four integers are needed: the modulus m, the multiplier a, the increment c, and seed x , with  2 ≤< m , 0                                                                                                0                                                                                     { }              ≤ c < m,  0 ≤  x <  m . We generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers  x    , with 0 ≤  x <  m  for all                            0                                                          m              n              n, by successively using the recursively defined function                                                                    )                                                     x    = ( ax + c  mod  m                                                      n+ 1     n               Example               Find the sequence of pseudorandom numbers generated by the linear congruential method with modulus              m = 9, multiplier a = 7, increment c = 4, and seed  x = .                                                                   3                                                               0              Solution                                                                                                        )                 Compute the terms of the sequence by successively using the congruence  x    = ( 7x + 4 mod ,                                                                                                               9                                                                                          n + 1    n                           3                 with  x = .                        0                                  )                     x  = ( 7x +  4 mod  9 = (7 3 4⋅+  ) mod  9 =  25 mod  9 =  7                      1      0                                  )                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod   9 =  (7 7 4⋅+  ) mod  9 53 mod  9 = 8                                                              =                      2       1                                   )                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 = (7 8 4⋅+  ) mod  9 60 mod  9 =  6                                                              =                      3       2                                   )                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 =  (7 6 4⋅+  ) mod  9 =  46 mod  9 = 1                      4       3                                   )                                                     )                                                              =                                                ⋅+                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 = (7 1 4 mod    9 11 mod   9 = 2                      5       4                                   )                                                     )                                                ⋅+                                                              =                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 =  (7 24 mod    918 mod     9 =  0                      6       5                                   )                     x  = ( 7x +  4 mod   9 = (70 4⋅+  ) mod  9 = 4 mod  9 =  4                      7       6                                   )                                                     )                                                              =                                                ⋅+                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 = (7 4 4 mod    9 32 mod    9 = 5                      8       7                                  )                                                     )                                                              =                     x  = ( 7x + 4 mod    9 =  (7 5 4 mod   9 39 mod    9 = 3                                                ⋅+                      9       8                 The sequence generated is 3, 7, 8, 6, 1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 8, 6, 1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3, …  It repeats after                 generating 9 terms.                  Commonly, computers use a linear congruential generator with increment c = 0.

If the final digit is not correct, then the string is assumed not to be correct.             Example            Retail products are identified by their Universal Product Codes (UPCs). Usually these have 12 decimal           digits, the last one being the check digit. The check digit is determined by the congruence:                       3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x +  3x +  x  +  3x  +  x  ≡  0  (mod  10 )                         1   2     3    4     5    6     7    8     9   10     11    12             a)  Suppose that the first 11 digits of the UPC are 79357343104.

We can reach the first rung of the ladder.                 2.  If we can reach a particular rung of the ladder,                     then we can reach the next rung.               From (1), we can reach the first rung. Then by              applying (2), we can reach the second rung. Applying              (2) again, the third rung. And so on.  We can apply (2)              any number of times to reach any particular rung, no              matter how high up.               This example motivates proof by mathematical              induction.                     Mathematical Induction              Principle of Mathematical Induction               To prove that P(n) is true for all positive integers n, we               complete these steps:                   Basis Step: Show that P(1) is true.                   Inductive Step: Show that P(k) → P(k + 1)  is true for all positive integers k.               To complete the inductive step, assuming the inductive hypothesis that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer              k, show that must P(k + 1) be true.                Climbing an Infinite Ladder Example:                BASIS STEP: By (1), we can reach rung 1.               INDUCTIVE STEP: Assume the inductive hypothesis that we can reach rung k. Then by (2), we can                                   reach rung k + 1.                   Hence, P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k. We can reach every rung on the ladder.                                                                131","Examples of Proofs by Mathematical induction            Mathematical induction can be expressed as the rule of inference                                                                                ( )                                                       ( ) →                                         ( P ( ) 1 ∧∀  ( k Pk  Pk   1 ))) → ∀ nPn                                                               ( +           where the domain is the set of positive integers.           In a proof by mathematical induction, we don’t assume that P(k) is true for all positive integers! We show           that if we assume that P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) must also  be true.           Proofs by mathematical induction do not always start at the integer 1. In such a case, the basis step begins           at a starting point b where b is an integer.             Validity of Mathematical Induction            Mathematical induction is valid because of the well ordering property, which states that every nonempty           subset of the set of positive integers has a least element. Here is the proof:              Suppose that P(1) holds and P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k.              Assume there is at least one positive integer n for which P(n) is false. Then the set S of positive                integers for which P(n) is false is nonempty.              By the well-ordering property, S has a least element, say m.              We know that m cannot be 1 since P(1) holds.              Since m is positive and greater than 1, m − 1 must be a positive integer. Since m − 1 < m, it is not in                S, so P(m − 1) must be true.              But then, since the conditional P(k) → P(k + 1)  for every positive integer k holds, P(m) must also                be true. This contradicts P(m) being false.              Hence, P(n) must be true for every positive integer n             Example                                                                  ( nn +  ) 1           Show that if n is a positive integer, then 12++ +  n =                                                                    2           Solution                                               ( 1 1 1+  )              Basis Step: P(1) is true since 1 =      = 1.                                                 2                                                                                               ( kk +  ) 1              Inductive Step: Assume true for P(k).

Sometimes the recursive definition has an exclusion rule, which specifies that the set contains nothing              other than those elements specified in the basis step and generated by applications of the rules in the              recursive step.              We will always assume that the exclusion rule holds, even if it is not explicitly mentioned.               We will later develop a form of induction, called structural induction, to prove results about recursively              defined sets.

Recursive step: If x ∊ S and y ∊ S, then x + y is in S.                     Initially 3 is in S, then 3 + 3 = 6, then 3 + 6 = 9, etc.                Example               Consider the subset N of the set of natural numbers recursively defined by                  Basis step: 0 ∊ N.                 Recursive step: If n is in N, then n + 1 is in N.

We can define the concatenation of two strings, denoted           by ∙, recursively as follows.                               *           Basis step: If w ∈ Σ , then w ∙ λ= w.                                                  *                                    *           Recursive step: If  w ∈Σ  and  w ∈Σ and x ∈ Σ, then   w ⋅     ( wx =  ) ( w ⋅  w  ) x .                              1             2                         1    2       1    2                Often  w ⋅ w  is written as  w w .                          1   2               12                If  w =  abra  and  w =  cadabra , the concatenation  w w =  abracadabra.                      1              2                                12             Length of a String            Example            Give a recursive definition of l(w), the length of the string w.

The Tower of Hanoi            In the late nineteenth century, the French mathematician Édouard Lucas invented a puzzle, called the           Tower of Hanoi, consisting of three pegs on a board with disks of different sizes. Initially all of the disks           are on the first peg in order of size, with the largest on the bottom            Rules: You are allowed to move the disks one at a time from one peg to another as long as a larger disk is                  never placed on a smaller.            Goal: Using allowable moves, end up with all the disks on the second peg in order of size with largest on                  the bottom.

Let a  be the number of                                                                                              0              valid n-digit codewords.

There are two ways to form a valid string with n digits from a                 string with one fewer digit.                  1.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a valid string of n – 1 digits with a digit                     other than 0. This appending can be done in 9 ways. Hence, a valid string with n digits can be                      formed in this manner in 9a     ways.                                                n− 1                 2.  A valid string with n digits can be obtained by appending a 0 to a string of length n – 1 that is not                     valid. The number of ways that this can be done equals the number of invalid (n – 1)-digit strings.                      Because there are 10 n− 1  strings of length n – 1, and  a   are valid, there are 10 n− 1 − a   valid                                                                         n− 1                            n− 1                     n –digit strings obtained by appending an invalid string of length n – 1 with a 0.                     Because all valid strings of length n are produced in one of these two ways, it follows that there                     are                             a =  9a     +  ( 10 n− 1  −  a  )                              n     n−  1           n−  1                                 =  8a   + 10 n− 1                                    n− 1                         Valid strings of length n.                                                                                            179","Example             Find a recurrence relation for C , the number of ways to parenthesize the product of  n + 1 numbers,                                         n           x ⋅  x ⋅  x   x ⋅  , to specify the order of multiplication.

Hence  c =  ( n ma ) (nm a=  ) , so a divides c.              Therefore this relation is transitive.

Definition               Two elements a and b that related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The notation  a   is                                                                                                               b              often used to denotes that a and b are equivalent elements with respect to a particular equivalence relation.                Example                Let R be the relation on the set of integers such that aRb if and only if a = b or a = −b. It follows that R is              an equivalence relation.                Example               Let R be the relation on the set of real numbers such that aRb if and only if a −b is an integer . Is R an              equivalence relation?               Solution                 Because a – a = 0 is an integer for all real numbers a, aRa for all real numbers a. Hence, R is reflexive                 Suppose that aRb, then a – b is an integer, so b – a and b – c are integers.                 Therefore, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is also an integer. Hence, aRc.                 Thus, R is transitive. Consequently, R is an equivalence relation.                Example                                                                            ,              Let m be an integer with m > 1. Show that the relation  R =  ( { a  b ) | a ≡ b  (mod  m  } )  is an equivalence              relation on the set of integers.              Solution                   a ≡  b  (mod  m ) iff m divides a – b.                 Since  0 =  0 m  then a – a = 0 is divisible by m. Hence,  a ≡  a  (mod  m ) , so congruence modulo m is                            ⋅                 reflexive.                 Suppose that  a ≡ b  (mod  m ), then a – b is divisible by m, so a – b = km, where k is an integer. It                  follows that b – a = (−k)m, so b ≡  a  (mod  m ). Hence, congruence modulo m is symmetric.                 Suppose that  a ≡ b  (mod  m ) and b ≡  c  (mod  m ), then m divides both a – b and b – c. so  a −=  km                                                                                                           b                                                                                                    +                         c                 and  b − =  lm, where k and l are integers. It follows that a c− =  (a b−  ) (b c+  −  ) =  km lm = (k l m+  ) ,                 so  a ≡  c  (mod  m ) . Hence, congruence modulo m is transitive.                 The congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation.                                                                213","Example            Let n be a positive integer and S a set of strings.

Because s, t and u are all at least n characters long s and u begin with same n characters as t does.

A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a partially ordered set, or poset, and is           denoted by (S, R). Members of S are called elements of the poset.

Maximal and Minimal Elements           An element of a poset is called maximal if it is not less than any element of the poset.

Each edge           has either one or two vertices (plural of vertex) associated with it, called its endpoints. An edge is said to           connect its endpoints.           Visualize the graphs by using points to represent vertices and line segments, possibly curved, to represent           edges, where the endpoints of a line segment representing an edge are the points representing the edge-           endpoints.

Graphs that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices are called multigraphs.           Sometimes a communications link connects a data center with itself, a feedback loop for diagnostic           purposes. Such edges are called loops.            Graphs that may include loops, and possibly multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices or a           vertex to itself, are sometimes called pseudographs.

Such an edge e is called incident with the vertices u and v and e is said to           connect u and v.                                                                    228","Graph Terminology                         Type                     Edges            Multiple Edges Allowed?

Suppose each of the people were friends with exactly five others. Then the degree of each of the 9              vertices of the graph would be 5, and so the total degree of the graph would be 45 (odd).

A bipartite graph G is a simple graph whose vertex set can be portioned into two disjoint nonempty                subsets V  and V  such that vertices in V  may be connected to vertices in V , but no vertices in                         1       2                      1                                  2                                                              238","V  are connected to other vertices in V  and no vertices in V  are connected to other vertices in V                    1                                   1                     2                                   2                   . For example, the graph G illustrated in (i) can be redrawn as shown in (ii). From the drawing in                    (ii), you can see that G is bipartite with mutually disjoint vertex set V = { v v  , v  }  and                                                                                            ,                                                                                     1     1   3   5                   V =  { v  ,  v  ,  v  }                    1     2   4   6                             (i)                              (ii)                                   v                                  v 1          v 2                                  1                 v                                                     3                                                                   v             v                                                                    3              4                                  v                                v             v                                   6                v               5              6                                                     4                                             v                                            5                     a)                                   b)                              c)                                 d)                                   e)                              f)                                                                                                   239","Section 4.7 − Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphism               Sometimes, two graphs have exactly the same form, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence           between their vertex sets that preserves edges.

In Particular, we can show that two           graphs are not isomorphic if we can find a property only one of the two graphs has, but that is preserved           by isomorphism. A property preserved by isomorphism of graphs is called a graph invariant.             Example            Show that the graphs shown below are not isomorphic                                          G                          H           Solution               Both graphs G \& H have 5 vertices and 6 edges.              H has a vertex of degree one, @ e, whereas G has no vertices of degree one.              It follows that G \& H are not isomorphic.             Example            Determine whether the graphs shown below are isomorphic                                            G                                   H            Solution               Both graphs G \& H have 8 vertices and 10 edges.              Also both have 4 vertices of degree 2 and 4 vertices of degree 3.                        2               deg ( ) a =  in G, a must correspond to either t, u ,x, or y in H, because these are the vertices of degree              2 in H. However, each of these four vertices in H is adjacent to another vertex of degree 2 in H, which              is not true for a in G. Therefore, G \& H are not isomorphic.                                                                244","Another way to see that G \& H are not isomorphic is by checking the subgraphs of G \& H  shown                 below, they have a different shape.

Also both have 4 vertices of degree 2 and 2 vertices of degree 3.                 From the subgraphs of G \& H, all vertices of degree 2 and the edges connecting them are isomorphic.                 u ↔   v    u u u u ↔    v vv v                   1    6    4 5 6 2      5 1 2 3                                                                                               245","Exercises         Section 4.7 − Representing Graphs and Graph                                             Isomorphism               Use the adjacency list to represent the given graph, then represent with an adjacency matrix              1.                                   2.                           3.                                   4.                       5.

Definitions               Let G be a graph, and let v and w be vertices in G.              A walk from v to w is a finite alternating sequence of adjacent vertices and edges of G.

A closed walk is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex.               A circuit is a closed walk that contains at least one edge and does not contain a repeated edge.

Hence by the contrapositive form, this graph does                        1    3              not have an Euler circuit.             Definition            Let G be a graph, and let v and w be two distinct vertices of G. An Euler trail from v to w is a sequence of           adjacent edges and vertices that starts at v, ends at w, passes through every vertex of G at least once, and           traverses every edge of G exactly once.             Example            Many puzzles ask you to draw a picture in a continuous motion without lifting a pencil so that no part of           the picture is retraced. We can solve such puzzles using Euler circuits and paths. For example, can           Mohammed’s scimitars, shown in Figure below, be drawn in this way, where the drawing begins and ends           at the same point?                     Solution              Let denote G for the graph. G has an Euler circuit, because all its vertices have even degree.              1.  Form the circuit: a, b, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. We obtain the subgraph H by deleting the edges in this                  circuit and all vertices that become isolated when these edges are removed.              2.  Form: d, g, h, j, i, h, k, g, f, d in H. After forming this circuit we have used all edges in G. Splicing                  this new circuit into the first circuit at the appropriate place produces the Euler circuit a, b, d, g, h,                  j, i, h, k, g, f, d, c, b, e, i, f, e, a. This circuit gives a way to draw the scimitars without lifting the                  pencil or retracting part of the picture.                                                                                        258","Hamilton Path and Circuits               A simple path in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamilton path, and a              simple circuit G in a graph G that passes through every vertex exactly once is called a Hamilton circuit.                                                                                 )                                           ,                                        ,              That is, the simple path  x  x  , x   , x  in the graph G =  ( ,V E  is a Hamilton path if                                      0   1       n− 1  n                         ,                                                                 j                                                                    n              V = { x 0 , x  , x n− 1 , x n }  and  x ≠  x  for 0 i≤ < ≤ , and the simple circuit                        1                                                    j                                               i                    ,                                                                             ,                                                                                ,              x  , x   , x   , x  , x  (with n > 0) is a Hamilton circuit if  x  x  , x  , x  is a Hamilton path.               0   1       n− 1  n   0                                     0   1       n− 1  n                         Hamilton’s  “A Voyage Round the World” Puzzle       Solution to the “A Voyage Round the World”                                                                                          Puzzle                Example               Which of the simple given graphs have a Hamilton circuit or, if not, a Hamilton path?
