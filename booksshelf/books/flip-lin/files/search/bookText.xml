             Elimination produces an upper triangular system.

                       x −   2y =  1   x −   2y =  1  Mutliply  by  3
                                  ⇒  
                      3x +  2y =  11          8y =  8  and  subtract
             The equation 8y =  8 reveals   y = 1

             This process is called back substitution.























                                  Before elimination                         After elimination


             Definitions


             Pivot:     first nonzero in the row that does the elimination
             Multiplier:  (entry to eliminate) divide by pivot


                    4x −  8y =  4  Multiply equation  1 by  3  4x −  8y =  4
                                                         4
                    3x +  2y =  11 Subtract from equation  2      8y =  8

             The first pivot is 4 (the coefficient of x) and the multiplier is l =  3
                                                                           4
             The pivots are on the diagonal of the triangle after elimination.


             Definition

             The operations are the elementary reduction operations, or row operations, or Gaussian operations. They
             are swapping, multiplying by a scalar or rescaling, and pivoting.

             If a homogeneous linear system has n unknowns, and if the reduced row echelon form of its augmented
             matrix has r nonzero rows, then the system has n − r free variables.



             Theorem

             A homogeneous linear system with more unknowns than equations has infinitely many unknowns.

          Definition

          A square matrix is nonsingular if it is the matrix of coefficient of a homogeneous system, with a unique
          solution. It is singular otherwise, that is, if it is the matrix of coefficients of a homogeneous system, with
          infinitely many solutions.

             Section 1.4 – Inverse Matrices - Finding  A


             Definition

             The matrix A is invertible if there exists a matrix  A − 1  such that:

                                      1
                                    −
                                         =
                                   A A AA      −  1  =  I
             where  A − 1  read    "  inverse " and A has to be a square matrix.
                              as
                                  A

                    Not all matrices have inverses.

             1.  The inverse exists iff elimination produces n pivots (row exchanges allow).

             2.  The matrix A cannot have two different inverses.

                                                                                 −
                                                                                  1
             3.  If A is invertible, the one and only one solution to  Ax =  B  is  x =  AB
                           AX =   B
                              )
                                                                      -1
                    A −  1 ( AX =  A −  1 B      Multiply both side by A
                    (  −  1  )     −  1
                     A   AX =    A   B           Associate property

                                    1
                                   −
                           IX =  AB              Multiplicative inverse property
                                   1
                                  −
                           X =  AB               Identity property

             4.  Suppose there is a nonzero vector x such that  Ax = . Then A cannot have an inverse
                                                                  0

             5.  A 2 by 2 matrix is invertible iff  ad bc−    is not zero.

             A − 1  exists when A has a full set of n pivots. (Row exchanges allowed)

                •  With n pivots, elimination solves all the equations  Ax =  b . The columns  x  go into  A − 1 . Then
                                                                        i   i                i

                •  Elimination is really a sequence of multiplications.


             Conclusion

                If A doesn’t have n pivots, elimination will lead to a zero row.

                Elimination steps are taken by an invertible M. So a row of MA is zero.
                If  AB =  then  MAB =   M . The zero row of MA, times B, gives a zero row of M.

                The invertible matrix M can’t have a zero row! A must have n pivots if  AB = .

             Two matrices A and B are row-equivalent if and only if they have the same reduced echelon form.

             Proof

             If A and B have the same reduced echelon form E, then A is row-equivalent to E and E is row-equivalent
             to B. It follows that A is row-equivalent to B.
             Now Suppose A and B are row-equivalent. Let  E  be a reduced echelon form of A and  E  be a reduced
                                                            1                                      2
             echelon form of B. Then  E  and  E  are row equivalent.
                                       1       2
             Suppose  E =  IF    and   E =  IF . Since  E  and  E  are row equivalent,  E =  CE for some matrix

             C. This means  I = CI  and  F = CF . But then C =  I  and   F =  F .

          Trace

          Definition

          If A is a square matrix, then the trace of A, denoted by tr(A), is defined to the sum of the entries on the
          main diagonal of A. The trace of A is undefined if A is not a square matrix.

          The goal is to describe Gaussian elimination in the most useful way by looking at them closely, which are
          factorizations of a matrix.
             The factors are triangular matrices.
             The factorization that comes from elimination is  A LU=  .

             If A and B are symmetric matrices with the same size, and if k is any scalar, then:

              b)  A + B and A – B are symmetric.

              c)  kA is symmetric


                 If A is an invertible symmetric matrix, then  A − 1  is symmetric.

             Proof

                Assume that A is symmetric and invertible then  A =  A

                                                     c d


          The determinant is zero when the matrix has no inverse.


          Properties of the Determinants

          By using these property rules, we can compute the determinant of any square matrix.

          1.  Determinant of the n by n identity matrix is 1.
                                   1
                  10   = 1 and        1    = 1
                  01
                                         1


          2.  Determinant changes sign when 2 rows are exchanged.
                  ab    =  ad −  bc  c  d  =  bc ad =  −  (ad −  bc ) ⇒  ab  =  −  c  d
                                              −
                  c  d             ab                                c  d     ab

          3.  Determinant is a linear function of each row separately.

                                                  ta tb     a   b
                 Multiply row 1 by any number t:         = t
                                                  c   d     c   d


                                                a a′+   b b′ +  a   b    a′  b′
                 Add row 1 of A to row 1 of A ′:              =       +
                                                  c       d     c   d    c   d


                        For 2 by 2 determinants, if you expand to a rectangle, the determinants equal areas.

                        For n-dimensional, the determinants equal volumes.

             4.  If 2 rows of A are equal, thendetA= .
                     a b  =  ab ab =  0
                               −
                     a b


             5.  Subtracting a multiple of one row from another row leaves detA unchanged.

                       a      b      ab
                    c ta d −    ta  =  c  d

             6.  A matrix with a row of zeros has detA= .
                     a b  =  0 and    00   =  0

                     00               bc

             7.  If A is triangular then detA aa         a   = product of diagonal entries.
                                            =

                                             0
             8.  If A is singular then detA= .
             9.  If A is invertible then detA  ≠ 0.


             10. The determinant of AB detA is times detB :  AB =    A B


                                                                                 ( )

          Theorem

          Let A be any n  by n matrix.

           a)  If A′  is the matrix that results when a single row of A is multiplied by a constant k, then

               det A′      det ( ) A .
                   ( ) k=
                                                                                          ( )
           b)  If A′  is the matrix that results when two rows of A are interchanged, then det A′ = − det ( ) A
           c)  If A′  is the matrix that results when a multiple of one row of A is added to another row then
               det ( ) detA′ =  ( ) A

          Network Analysis


          Networks composed of branches and junctions are used as models in such fields as economics, traffic
          analysis, and electrical engineering.
          In a network model, you assume that the total flow into a junction is equal to the total flow out of the
          junction


          Example


          Set up a system of linear equations to represent the network shown below. Then solve the system for
          x  ,  i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

          An electrical network is another type of network where analysis is commonly applied. An analysis of such
          a system uses two properties of electrical networks known as Kirchhoff’s Laws.

              All the current flowing into a junction must flow out of it.
              The sum of the products IR (I is current and R is resistance) around a closed path is equal to the total
               voltage in the path.

             Section 2.1 – Vectors in 2-Space, 3-Space, and n-Space




             Vectors in two dimensions are also called 2−space
             Vectors in three dimensions are also called 3−space by arrow

             The direction of the arrowhead specifies the direction of the vector and
             the length of the arrow specifies the magnitude.


             The tail of the arrow is called the initial point of the vector and the tip the terminal point.

          The vector spaces are denoted by    1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   . Each space    consists of a whole collection of
          vectors.

                      n
          The space    consists of all column vectors v with n components.

          The one-dimensional space    is a line (like the x-axis)

                                                                                                         n
          The two essential vector operations go on inside the vector space that we can add any vectors in   , and
          we can multiply any vector by any scalar. The result stays in the space.

          A real vector space is a set of “vectors” together with rules for vector addition and for multiplication by
          real numbers. The addition and the multiplication must produce vectors that are in the space.


                                                 n
          Here are three other spaces other than   :
             M  The vector space of all real 2 by 2 matrices.

             F  The vector space of all real functions  ()fx .

             Z  The vector space that consists only of a zero vector.

                              3
          The zero vector in   is the vector (0, 0, 0).

             Then, the Schwarz inequality says that: 2ab ≤  a +  2  b
                    a +  2  b −  2  2ab =  (a b−  ) ≥  2  0

               cockpit of the plane shows that your plane is pointed due East, and the airspeed indicator on the
               plane shows that the plane is traveling through the air at 400 mph. there is a crosswind that affects
               your plane however, and the crosswind is blowing due South at 40 mph.
               Given the crosswind you wonder; relative to the ground, in what direction are you really flying and
               how fast are you really traveling?

               direction 60° north of east. The airplane holds its compass heading due east but, because of the
               wind, acquires a new ground speed and direction. What speed and direction should the jetliner have
               in order for the resultant vector to be 500 mph due east?

               flies 10 km in the direction due southeast and lands atop a telephone pole. Place an xy-coordinate

             Definition

                                             n
             Two nonzero vectors u  and v  in    are said to be orthogonal (or perpendicular) if their dot product is
                  
             zero uv =  0 .

                                                                                          n
                                                      n
             We will also agree that he zero vector in    is orthogonal   to every vector in  . A nonempty set of
                      n
             vectors     is called an orthogonal   set if all pairs of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal. An
             orthogonal set of unit vectors is called an orthonormal set.


             Example

             The floor of your room (extended to infinity) is a subspace V. The line where two walls meet is a
             subspace W (one-dimensional). Those subspaces are orthogonal. Every vector up the meeting line is
             perpendicular to every vector on the floor. The origin (0, 0, 0) is in the corner.


             Example

             Show that u   = (−2, 3, 1, 4) and v   = (1, 2, 0, −1) are orthogonal in 

               In 1773, Joseph Louis Lagrange introduced the component form of both the dot and cross products
               in order to study the tetrahedron in three dimensions. In 1843 the Irish mathematical physicist Sir
               William Rowan Hamilton introduced the quaternion product, and with it the terms "vector" and
                                                                                             3
               "scalar". Given two quaternions [0, u ] and [0, v  ], where u   and v  are vectors in    , their
                                                              ,  u × 
               quaternion product can be summarized as [ uv−     ] v . James Clerk Maxwell used Hamilton's
               quaternion tools to develop his famous electromagnetism equations, and for this and other reasons
               quaternions for a time were an essential part of physics education.

             Definition

             scalar multiplication defined in V.

             Theorem


             If W is a set of one or more vectors in a vector space V, then W is a subspace of V iff the following
             conditions holds
                             
                                                      

                1.  If u  and v  are vectors in W, then u v  is in W.

                2.  If k is any scalar and v  is any vector in W, the kv  is in the subspace in W.


               The most fundamental ideas in linear algebra are that the plane is a subspace of the full vector space
                  n
                  .

                                                                             3
               Every subspace contains the zero vector. The plane vector in    has to go through (0, 0, 0).
                From rule (2), if we choose  k =  and the rule requires 0v to be in the subspace.
                                               0



             The axioms that are not inherited by W are

             Axiom 1 – Closure of W under addition
             Axiom 4 – Existence of a zero vector in W

             Axiom 5 – Existence of a negative in W for every vector in W
             Axiom 6 – Closure of W under scalar multiplication







                                                              121]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[Example

          Keep only the vectors ( ,   )  whose components are positive or zero (first quadrant “quarter-plane”).
                                 xy
                          )
          The vector (2, 3  is included but ( 2, 3−  −  )  is not.  So, rule (2) is violated when we try  k = − 1. The
          quarter-plane is not a subspace.


          Example

          Include also the vectors whose components are both negative. Now we have two quarter-planes. Rule (ii)
                                                                                   )
          satisfies when we multiply by any c. But rule (i) fails.  The sum of v =  (2, 3 and w =  ( 3,−  −  2 ) is ( 1, 1−  )
          which is outside the quarter-plane. Two quarter-planes don’t make a subspace.

             The solution set of a homogeneous linear system  Ax =  in n unknowns is a subspace of 


             Proof

                Let W be the solution set for the system. The set W is not empty because it contains at least the trivial

                                                  n
                To show that W is a subspace of  , we must show that it is closed under addition and scalar
                multiplication.

                Let   x  and  x  be vectors in W and these vectors are solution of  Ax =  .
                                                                                    0

                Therefore,

             columns.

          The dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space V is denoted by dim(V) and is defined to be the

          number of vectors in a basis for V. in addition, the zero-vector space is defined to have dimension zero.


             1.  Dim(V) = # elements in basis. If V is finite.

             2.  If V = { } 0 , then Dim(V) = 0, even though there is no basis.

             3.  Dim(V) may be infinite.

          Rank of a Matrix

          The rank of a matrix A (m by n) is the number of nonzero rows in the row-reduced echelon form of A (it
          is the number of pivot). The common dimension of the row space and column space of a matrix A is
          called the rank of A and is denoted by


                                                           rank () r
                                                                   =

          Note:
             The rank of a matrix is well defined due to the uniqueness of the row-reduced echelon form. No
             matter what sequence of elementary row operations is performed to put the given matrix in row-
             reduced echelon form; there will always be the same number of nonzero rows.


          Theorem

          The row space and column space of a matrix A have the same dimension



          The objective is to connect rank and dimension.

             •  The rank of a matrix is the number of pivots.
             •  The dimension of a subspace is the number of vectors in a basis.


             A has full row rank if every row has a pivot: r =  m. No zero in R.

                                                                       n
             A has full column rank if every column has a pivot:  r = . No free variables.

          Definition

          A set of two or more vectors in a real inner product space is said to be orthogonal if all pairs of distinct
          vectors in the set are orthogonal. An orthogonal set in which each vector has norm 1 is said to be
          orthonormal.

             The equation  A QR=   is a factorization of A into the product of a matrix Q with orthonormal column

             vectors and an invertible upper triangular matrix R. We call it the QR-decomposition of A.


             Theorem

             If A is an mn×  matrix with linearly independent column vectors, then A can be factored as

                                                              =

                                                                      +
                  constant.








                  Suppose a particular unstretched spring has a measured length of 6.1 inches.(i.e., x = 6.1 when

                   y =  0 ). Forces of 2 pounds, 4 pounds, and 6 pounds are then applied to the spring, and the
                  corresponding lengths are found to be 7.6 inches, 8.7 inches, and 10.4 inches. Find the spring

             Definition

             If V and W are vector spaces, and if f  is a function with domain V and codomain W, then we say that f is a
             transformation from V to W or that f maps V to W, which we denote by writing
                                                             : fV → W

             In the special case where V = W, the transformation is also called an operator on V.

             The subspace dimensions for A are the same as for R.

             These matrices are connected by an invertible matrix E.  EA =  R and  A =  E − 1 R


             1.  A has the same row space as R. Same dimension r and same basis
                  Every row of A is a combination of the rows of R. Also every row of R is a combination of the rows
                  of A.

             2.  The column space of A has dimension r. The number of independent columns equals the number of
                independent rows.

             3.  A has the same nullspace as R. Dimension n – r and same basis.

             Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra, (Part 1)

             The column space and row space both have dimension r.

          Each m by n matrix does produce a linear transformation from  V =   to W =  . When a linear T is
          described as a “rotation” or “projection” or “...” is there always a matrix hiding behind T?

          The answer is yes. This is an approach to linear algebra that doesn’t start with matrices. The next section
          shows that we still end up with matrices.

             The goal is to describe Gaussian elimination in the most useful way by looking at them closely, which are
             factorizations of a matrix.

                The factors are triangular matrices.
                The factorization that comes from elimination is  A LU=  .

             Eigenvalues of AB and A + B

             An eigenvalue of A times an eigenvalue of B usually does not give an eigenvalue of AB.

             eigenvector matrix P if and only if AB = BA.

        Definition

        If A and B are square matrices, then we say that B is similar to A if there exists an invertible matrix P such

        that  B =  P −  1 AP or  A =  PBP −  1


                                                                          
                                                                                                            
            Similar matrices B and  M − 1 AM  have the same eigenvalues. If  x  is an eigenvector of A then  M − 1 x  is
            an eigenvector of  B =  M − 1 AM .

        Proof

              Since  B =  M −  1 AM ⇒  A =  MBM  −  1
                             
              Suppose  Ax λ=  x :
                                     
                               
                       MBM   − 1 x =  λ x

                                       
                       BM  −  1 x =  λ M −  1 x
              The eigenvalue of B is the same λ. The eigenvector is now  M − 1 x

            Choose  M =         ; the similar matrix  M  AM          

                                0 − 1                                  .5  − .5
            Also choose  M =          ; the similar matrix  M − 1 AM          
                                                                    s

            These matrices  M − 1 AM  all have the same eigenvalues 1 and 0.
            Every 2 by 2 matrix with those eigenvalues is similar to A.

            The eigenvectors change with M.

        For every A, we want to choose M so that  M − 1 AM  is as nearly diagonal as possible. When A has a full set

        of n eigenvectors, they go into the columns of M. Then M = P. The matrix  P − 1 AP is diagonal.

        If A has s independent eigenvectors, it is similar to a matrix J that has s Jordan blocks on its diagonal.
        There is a matrix M such that

                                                          J   1      

        Each block in J has one eigenvalue λ , one eigenvector, and 1’s above the diagonal:

        A is similar to B if they share the same Jordan form J – not otherwise.

             Definition

             A square matrix A is called orthogonally diagonalizable if there is an orthogonal matrix P such that

                    (
                         T
             P − 1 AP =  P AP  is diagonal; the matrix P is said to orthogonally diagonalize A.
                                                             T
                                                           P AP =   D

             We say that A is orthogonally diagonalizable and that P orthogonally diagonalizes A.


             Theorem

             If A is an n x n matrix, then the following are equivalent.

              a)  A is orthogonally diagonalizable

              b)  A has an orthonormal set of n eigenvectors.
              c)  A is symmetric.


             Theorem

             If A is symmetric matrix, then:

              a)  The eigenvalues of A are all real numbers.
              b)  Eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.

                  They are perpendicular because _______. (why are these subspaces orthogonal?) If the second
                  eigenvalue is a nonzero number  β, apply this argument to  A β−  I . The eigenvalue moves to zero and
                  the eigenvectors stay the same – so they are perpendicular.
