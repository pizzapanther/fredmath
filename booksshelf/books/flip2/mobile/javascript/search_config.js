Effective Rate               The effective rate corresponding to a started rate of interest r compounded m times per year is                                                                   r                                                         r =  e  ( 1+  m ) m  −  1              APY is also referred to as effective rate or true interest rate.                Example               The APY of a savings account is the percentage increase in the balance over the course of a year. Suppose              you deposit $500 in a savings account that has an APY of 6.18% per year. Assume that the interest rate              remains constant and that no additional deposits or withdrawals are made. How long will it take the balance              to reach $2500?

On the first day of the year (t =  ) 0 , a city uses electricity at a rate of 2000 MW. That rate is projected               to increase at a rate of 1.3% per year.               a)  Based on these figures, find an exponential growth function for the power (rate of electricity use)                  for the city.               b)  Find the total energy (in MW-yr) used by the city over four full years beginning at t =                                                                                                      0                                                                                        0               c)  Find a function that gives the total energy used (in MW-yr) between t =  and any future time                   t >  0          74.  Two points P and Q are chosen randomly, one on each of two adjacent sides of a unit square.                                  What is the probability that the area of the triangle formed by the sides of the square and the line               segment PQ is less than one-fourth the area of the square? Begin by showing that x and y must satisfy                xy <  1  in order for the area consition to be met. Then argue that the required probability is                    2                1  + ∫ 1     dx    and evaluate the integral.               2    1/2  2x                                                              134","75.

Imagine a cable, like a telephone line or TV cable, strung from one support to another and hanging               freely. The cable’s weight per unit length is a constant w and the horizontal tension at its lowest point               is a vector of length H. If we choose a coordinate system for the plane of the cable in which the x-axis               is horizontal, the force of gravity is straight down, the positive y-axis points straight up, and the               lowest point of the cable lies at the point  y =  H   on the y-axis, then it can be shown that the cable lies                                                           w               along the graph of the hyperbolic cosine                                                                  w                                                                   x                                                     y =  H  cosh ( )                                                         w       H                                                                              156","Such a curve is sometimes called a chain curve or a catenary, the latter deriving from the Latin                     catena, meaning “chain”.                                    )                     a)  Let  ( ,P xy  denote an arbitrary point on the cable. The next accompanying displays the tension                        H at the lowest point A.

Write down the substitution for x, calculate the differential dx, and specify the selected values of θ  for               the substitution.           2.  Substitute the trigonometric expression and the calculated differential into the integrand, and then               simplify the results algebraically.           3.  Integrate the trigonometric integral, keeping in mind the restrictions on the angle θ for reversibility.           4.  Draw an appropriate reference triangle to reserve the substitution in the integration result and convert it               back to the original variable x.

Many chemical reactions are the result of the interaction of 2 molecules that undergo a change to                  produce a new product.

If a is the amount of substance A and b is the substance B at time t = 0, and if x is                  the amount of product at time t, then the rate of formation of x may be given by the differential                  equation                                          dx  =  ( ka −  x )(b −  x ) or   1       dx  =  k                                         dt                         (a −  xb   x ) dt                                                                          )( −                  Where k is a constant for the reaction.

Simultaneously, a drain is opened at the bottom of the tank allowing the solution to leave tank               at a rate of 1 gal/min.

The Greeks solved several calculus problems almost 2000 years before the discovery of calculus. One               example is Archimedes’ calculation of the area of the region R bounded by a segment of a parabola,               which he did using the “method of exhaustion”.                                The idea was to fill R with an infinite sequence of triangles. Archimedes began with an isosceles               triangle inscribed in the parabola, with an area  A , and proceeded in stages, with the number of new                                                             1               triangles doubling at each stage. He was able to show (the key to the solution) that at each stage, the                                                            280","1                 area of a new triangle is   of the area of a triangle at the previous stage; for example,  A =  1  A , and                                          8                                                            2   8  1                                                                        4                 so forth.

An insulated windows consists of two parallel panes of glass with a small spacing between them.                  Suppose that each pane reflects a fraction p of the incoming light and transmits the remaining light.                 Considering all reflections of light between the panes, what fraction of the incoming light is ultimately                 transmitted by the windows? Assume the amount of incoming light is 1.                                91.  Suppose you borrow $20,000 for a new car at a monthly interest rate of 0.75%. If you make payments                 of $600/month, after how many months will the loan balance be zero?

Suppose a rubber ball, when dropped from a given height, returns to a fraction p of that height. In the                  absence of air resistance, a ball dropped from a height h requires   2h   seconds to fall to the ground,                                                                                   g                                    2                 where  g ≈ 9.8  m  / s  is the acceleration due to gravity.

It can be proved that if a series converges absolutely, then its terms may be summed in any order                 without changing the value of the series. However, if a series converges conditionally, then the value of                 the series depends on the order of summation. For example, the (conditionally convergent) alternating                 harmonic series has the value                                                      1−  1  +  1  −  1  +  =  ln 2                                                         2  3   4                  Show that by rearranging the terms (so the sign pattern is ++−),                                                 1+  1  −  1  +  1  +  1  −  1  +  =  3 ln 2                                                    3   2  5   7   4        2             131.  A crew of workers is constructing a tunnel through a mountain. Understandably, the rate of                 construction decreases because rocks and earth must be removed a greater distance as the tunnel gets                 longer. Suppose that each week the crew digs 0.95 of the distance it dug the previous week. In the first                 week, the crew constructed 100 m of tunnel.                   a)  How far does the crew dig in 10 weeks? 20 weeks? N weeks?                   b)  What is the longest tunnel the crew can build at this rate?                   c)  The time required to dig 100 m increases by 10% each week, starting with 1 week to dig the first                       100 m. Can the crew complete a 1.5 km tunnel in 10 weeks? Explain.              132.

The concentration in the blood resulting from a single dose of a drug normally decreases with time as                 the drug is eliminated from the body. Doses may therefore need to be repeated periodically to keep the                 concentration from dropping below some particular level. One model for the effect of repeated doses                 gives the residual concentration just before the (n +  ) 1 st  does as                                                       −  kt      −  2kt          −  nkt                                            R =  Ce     0  +  Ce    0  +  +  Ce    0                                             n     0          0               0                                                                                                )                   Where C = the change in concentration achievable by a single dose (mg mL ,                                                                                           /                            0                                                    ( )                       k =  the elimination constant  h − 1  , and                       t = time between doses (h).                        0                                                                   317","a)  Write  R  in closed form as a single fraction, and find  R =  lim R                            n                                                n→∞    n                 b)  Calculate  R  and  R   for C = 1 mg  / mL,   k =  0.1 h − 1 ,  and t = 10 h.

The series converges at x = a and diverges elsewhere (R = 0)               R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the interval of radius R centered at x = a is            called the interval of convergence.

If the interval of absolute convergence is finite, test for convergence or divergence at each endpoint.                  Use the Comparison Test, the Integral Test, or the Alternating Series Test.                                                                      a              3.  If the interval of absolute convergence is a R−  <  x <+  R , the series diverges for  xa−  >  R  (it does                  not even converge conditionally) because the nth term does not approach zero for those values of x.                                                                             325","Example                                                                      ∞                                                                    ∑    (2x +  ) 5  n         Determine the centre, radius, and interval of convergence of    (  2   )  n                                                                     n= 0  n +  13         Solution              ∑  ∞  (2x +  ) 5  n n ∑  =  ∞  ( ) n  2 1  ( x +  5 ) n                                     2                         )                                     3                                                    2                    2              n= 0 ( n + 13     n= 0     n +  1             The centre of convergence is                  x +  5  =  0 ⇒  x = − 5                     2                2                         ( ) n+ 1    1 2                         2                         3             L =  lim           (n +  ) 1  +  1                 n→∞        ( ) n  n + 1                             2                                   1                             3                                  2                             2               =  lim    2  n +  1                 n→∞    3  (n +  ) 1  2  +  1                =  2                 3               R =  1  =  3                  L    2              The series converges absolutely on interval                 ( − 5  3  ,  − −  5  +  3 ) =  ( 4,−  −  ) 1     a −  R <  x <  a +  R                                  2                             2                       2                   2                             ∑  ∞  ( ) 1−  n  ∑  ∞  ( ) 1−  n             At  x = − 4 ⇒          2     =        2                              n= 0  n + 1   n= 0  n + 1                                    2                        n <  2  (n +  ) 1                         2                             1                        n +<    (n +  ) 1  2  + 1                          1    >       1                         2                        n +  1    (n +  ) 1  2  +  1                        u >  u        √                         n     n+ 1                          1   →  0   √                         2                        n +  1                  By alternating series, it converges at  x = − .                                                          4                                                             326","∞                  ∞                                ∑        3 n               1                At  x =  − 1 ⇒       (  2   ) n ∑  =      2                                n= 0  n +  13      n= 0  n + 1                            ∫ 0 ∞    x + 1 =  tan − 1    x  ∞                                  dx                                 2                                                 0                                     =  tan −  1 ∞−  tan −  1 0                                     =  π                                      2                 By Integral Test, it converges at  x = − 1                 Therefore, the interval of convergence of the given power is [ 4, −  −  ] 1              Example                                                          ∞                                                        ∑     x n            Determine the radius of convergence of              ! n                                                         n= 0            Solution                 R =  lim    1  ( ⋅  n +  ) 1 !                    n→∞      ! n                            (n +  ) 1!                   =  lim                     n→∞        ! n                      =  lim  (   n +  ) 1                     n→∞                  = ∞                  This series converges (absolutely) for all x.
