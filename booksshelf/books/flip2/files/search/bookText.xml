          A cyclist pedals along a straight road with velocity  ( ) t =  2t −  2  8t +  6   (mi  / hr )  for 0 t≤≤ , where t is
          measured in hours.
           a)  Graph the velocity function over the interval [0, 3]. Determine when the cyclist moves in the
               position direction and when she moves in the negative direction.
           b)  Find the displacement of the cyclist (in miles) on the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [0, 3]. Interpret
               these results.

                 The velocity is zero at t = 1 and t = 3.

                 The velocity is positive on 0 t  1, which means the cyclist moves in the positive s direction.

          Suppose a skydiver leaps from a hovering helicopter and fall in a straight line. He falls at a terminal
          velocity of 80 m/s for 19 sec, at which time he opens his parachute. The velocity decreases linearly to 6

          m/s over two-second period and then remains constant until he reaches the ground at t = 40 s. The motion

             An artillery shell is fired directly upward with an initial velocity of
             300 m/s from a point 30 m above the ground. Assume that only the
             force of gravity acts on the shell and it produces an acceleration of

                The velocity decreases from its initial value of 300 m/s, reaching zero at the high point of the

                At this point the velocity becomes negative, and the shell begins its descent to Earth.

           A curved wedge is cut from a circular cylinder of radius 3 by two planes. One plane is perpendicular to

          the axis of the cylinder. The second place crosses the first plane at a 45° angle at the center of the
          cylinder. Find the volume of the wedge.
          Solution


             The base of the cylinder is a circle  x +  2  y =  2  9 .
             Since the second plane cut the base at the cylinder at the center, therefore, the base of the wedge is


             semi-circle.  y =  ±  9 x−  2  =  radius .
             When we slice the wedge by a plane perpendicular to the axis
             of the cylinder, we obtained a cross-section at x which is a
             rectangle of height x.
             The area of this cross-section is:

                               ×

             If the region we revolved to generate a solid does not border on or cross the axis of revolution, the solid
             has a hole in it. The cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of revolution are washers instead of disks.
             The dimensions of a typical washer are:

             Density and Mass

             Density is the concentration of mass in an object and is usually measured in units of mass per volume. An
             object with uniform density satisfies the basic relationship
                                                    mass =  density volume⋅

             When density of an object varies, this formula no longer holds, and we must appeal to calculus.

             Dams are built thicker at the bottom than at the top because the pressure against them increases with depth

             is  ( ) 0y  =  y  and the rate constant  k >  determines the rate of the growth. Exponential growth is
                        0
             characterized by a constant relative growth rate.


             Example

             Suppose the population of the town of Pine is given by  ( ) 1500 125P t =  +  t , while the population of the

             town of Spruce is given by  ( ) 1500e  0.1t  , where t ≥  is measured in years. Find the growth rate and
                                                                   0
                                       S t =
             the relative growth rate of each town.
             Solution

                 dP  = 125
                 dt
                 dS  = 150e 0.1t
                 dt
                The relative growth rate of Pine is
                 1 dP  =    125      , which decreases in time.
                 P dt   1500 125t+
                The relative growth rate of Spruce is

                 1 dS  =  150e 0.1t   = 0.1     Contant for all times
                 S dt   1500e 0.1t
                The linear population function has a constant absolute growth rate and the exponential population
                function has a constant relative growth rate.

             The balance in the account increases exponentially at a rate that can be determined from the advertised
             annual percentage yield (or APY) of the account.


             Effective Rate

             The effective rate corresponding to a started rate of interest r compounded m times per year is

                                                                r

             APY is also referred to as effective rate or true interest rate.


             Example

             The APY of a savings account is the percentage increase in the balance over the course of a year. Suppose
             you deposit $500 in a savings account that has an APY of 6.18% per year. Assume that the interest rate

              1.  Write down the substitution for x, calculate the differential dx, and specify the selected values of θ
                  for the substitution.

              2.  Substitute the trigonometric expression and the calculated differential into the integrand, and then
                  simplify the results algebraically.

              3.  Integrate the trigonometric integral, keeping in mind the restrictions on the angle θ for reversibility.
              4.  Draw an appropriate reference triangle to reserve the substitution in the integration result and
                  convert it back to the original variable x.

          Absolute and Relative Error

          Definition

          Suppose c is a computed numerical solution to a problem having an exact solution x.
          There are two common measures of the error in c as an approximation to x:

                                                                              −

          this approximation to π.

          Solution

              absolute error =   22  − π

          Definition

          Integrals with infinite limits of integration are improper integrals.

                   ∫  a ∞  f  ( ) x  dx =    b→∞∫  lim  a b  f  ( ) x  dx






          2.  If  ( ) x  is continuous on (−∞ , b ], then
                 f
                   b

          3.  If  ( ) x  is continuous on (−∞ , ∞ ), then

                 ∫  ∞  f  ( ) x dx = ∫  c  f  ( ) x dx + ∫  ∞  f  ( ) x dx

          In each case, if the limit is finite we say that the improper integral converges and that the limit is the value
          of the improper integral. If the limit fails to exist, the improper integral diverges.

             Integrands with Vertical Asymptotes


             Definition

             Integrals of functions that become infinite at a point within the interval of integration are improper
             integrals.
             If the limit is finite we say that the improper integral converges and that the limit is the value of the
             improper integral. If the limit does not exist, the integral diverges.

             Euler's method named after Leonhard Euler is an example of a fixed-step solver.
             Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
             with a given initial value. It is the most basic kind of explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary
             differential equations.

             Motion with Resistance Proportional to Velocity


             An object with a mass m is moving along a coordinate line with position function s and velocity v at time
             t.
             From Newton’s second law of motion, the resistance force opposing the motion is
                                                               ×
                                                  Force = mass acceleration
                                                            dv
                                                            =  m
                                                            dt

             If the resisting force is proportional to velocity, we have

                                                dv             dv     k
                                             m     =  −  kv or    =  −  v  (k >  ) 0
                                                dt             dt     m

             This is a separable differential equation, the solution with initial condition v =  v  at t = 0  is
                                                                                         0
                                                                     )
                                                        v = v e − ( /k mt
                                                             0

             In the English system, where the weight is measured in pounds, mass is measured in slugs. Thus,

                                                      Pounds =  slugs × 32



             Example

                                                 1
             For a 192-lb ice skater, the k is about   slug/sec and  m =  192  =  6  slugs . How long will it take the skater
                                                 3                   32
             to coast from 11 ft/sec (7.5 mph) to 1 ft/sec? How far will the skater coast before coming to a complete

          Example

          In an oil refinery, a storage tank contains 2,000 gal of gasoline that initially has 100 lb. of an additive
          dissolved in it. In preparation for winter weather, gasoline containing 2 lb. of additive per gallon is
          pumped into the tank at a rate of 40 gal/min. The well-mixed solution is pumped out at a rate of 45
          gal/min. How much of the additive is in the tank 20 min after the pumping process begins?

             2.   Suppose that an Iowa class battleship has mass 51,000 metric tons (51,000,000 kg) and

                  k ≈  59,000 kg  / sec . Assume that the ship loses power when it is moving at a speed of 9 m/sec.

             3.   A 200-gal tank is half full of distilled water. At time t = 0, a solution containing 0.5 lb./gal of
                  concentrate enters the tank at the rate of 5 gal/min, and the well-stirred mixture is withdrawn at the
                  rate of 3 gal/min.
                    a)  At what time will the tank be full?
                    b)  At the time the tank is full, how many pounds of concentrate will it contain?

        The sequence  a  n   converges to the number L if for every positive number ε there corresponds an integer N
        such that for all n,


                                                 n >  N  ⇒    a −  L <  ε

        If no such number L exists, we say  a n   diverges.

        The  a n   converges to L, we write  lim a = , or simply  a → , and call L the limit of the sequence.

        Show that  lim    1  =  0

        Solution

            Let ε > 0 be given. We must show that there exists an integer N such that for all n,

                                                   n >  N  ⇒     1  −  0 <  ε

            This implication will hold if   1  <  ε  or  n >  1  . If N is any integer greater than   1  , the implication will hold

           88.  The Greeks solved several calculus problems almost 2000 years before the discovery of calculus. One
                example is Archimedes’ calculation of the area of the region R bounded by a segment of a parabola,
                which he did using the “method of exhaustion”.

















                The idea was to fill R with an infinite sequence of triangles. Archimedes began with an isosceles
                triangle inscribed in the parabola, with an area  A , and proceeded in stages, with the number of new

                triangles doubling at each stage. He was able to show (the key to the solution) that at each stage, the

        Theorem − The Ratio Test

        Then
            a)  the series converges if ρ < 1,

            b)  the series diverges if ρ > 1, or ρ is infinite

            c)  the test is inconclusive if ρ = 1,


        The value ρ doesn’t mean the sum of the series.

            Because the limit is ρ = 1, we can’t decide from the Ratio Test whether the series converges.

            However, since  a n+ 1  always >  a , then the series diverges.

                without changing the value of the series. However, if a series converges conditionally, then the value of

           132.  A crew of workers is constructing a tunnel through a mountain. Understandably, the rate of
                construction decreases because rocks and earth must be removed a greater distance as the tunnel gets
                longer. Suppose that each week the crew digs 0.95 of the distance it dug the previous week. In the first
                week, the crew constructed 100 m of tunnel.


                  a)  How far does the crew dig in 10 weeks? 20 weeks? N weeks?
                  b)  What is the longest tunnel the crew can build at this rate?

        134.  The concentration in the blood resulting from a single dose of a drug normally decreases with time as
              the drug is eliminated from the body. Doses may therefore need to be repeated periodically to keep the

                                      ∑              n
        The convergence of the series      c n  ( xa−  )  is described by one of the following three cases:


          1.  There is a positive number R such the series diverges for x with  xa−  >  R  but converges absolutely for

              x with  xa−  <  R . The series may or may not converge at either of the endpoints  x =  a R−   and

              x =  a R+  .
                                                               )
          2.  The series converges absolutely for every x (R = ∞ .
          3.  The series converges at x = a and diverges elsewhere (R = 0)



        R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the interval of radius R centered at x = a is
        called the interval of convergence.



        Definition

                                 a                                                         n

                          n→∞     a n                                              n

        convergence  R =  1  . (If L = 0, then R = ∞; if L = ∞, then R = 0) and R =  lim  a n
                          L                                                    n→∞    a n+ 1



        How to Test a Power Series for Convergence

          1.  Use the Ratio Test (or Root Test) to find the interval where the series converges. Ordinarily, this is an
              open interval
                                                                           a
                                               xa−   <  R  or a R−   <  x <+  R
          2.  If the interval of absolute convergence is finite, test for convergence or divergence at each endpoint.
              Use the Comparison Test, the Integral Test, or the Alternating Series Test.

                                                                 a
                                                                                                −
          3.  If the interval of absolute convergence is  a R−  <  x <+  R , the series diverges for  xa >  R  (it does
              not even converge conditionally) because the nth term does not approach zero for those values of x.

             parametric curve. The equations are parametric equations for the curve





















             The variable t is a parameter for the curve, and its domain I is the parameter interval.

























             Definition

             The direction in which a parametric curve is generated as the parameter increases is called the forward or
             positive orientation of the curve.

          The problem with a pendulum clock whose bob swings in a circular arc is that the frequency of the swing
          depends on the amplitude of the swing.

















          Example

          A wheel of a radius a rolls along a horizontal straight line. Find parametric equations for the path traced
          by a point P on the wheel’s circumference. The path is called a cycloid.
          Solution
















             We take the line to be on the x-axis, mark a point P on the wheel, start the wheel with P at the origin,
             and roll the wheel. As parameter, we use the angle t through which the wheel turns, measured in

             To express θ in terms of t, we observe that t θ =  3π , so that θ =  3π  t −

             A Technique for Graphing

             One way to graph a polar equation  r =  f  ( ) θ  is to make a table of ( ,r θ  values, plot the corresponding
             points, and connect them in order of increasing.

             Another method of graphing more reliable is

              1.  First graph  r =  f  ( ) θ  in the Cartesian  rθ −  plane,

              2.  Then use the Cartesian graph as a table and guide to sketch the polar coordinate graph.
