Solution                 Let x = the width of the path                    l = the length of the pool and path                   w = the width of the pool and path                 l =  2x + 15                w =  2x + 12                           +                  ( 2 2x +  15 2x +  12 ) =  70     P =   ( 2 l +  w )                4x +  27 =  70                           2                        −                4x =  35 27                x =  8                    4                  =  2                 ∴ The width of the path is 2 meters.              Exercise             A pool measuring 10 m by 20 m is surrounded by a path of uniform width. If the perimeter of the pool and            the path combined is 92 m, what is the width of the path?             Solution                 Let x = the width of the path                                                               59","l = the length of the pool and path                 w = the width of the pool and path             l =  2x + 20             w =  2x + 10                        +               ( 2 2x +  20 2x +  10 ) =  92     P =   ( 2 l +  w )             4x +  30 =  92                        2             4x =  46 30                     −             x = 16                  4               =  4              ∴ The width of the path is 4 meters.           Exercise          A thief steals a number of rare plants from a nursery. On the way out, the thief meets three security guards,         one after another. To each security guard, the thief is forced to give one-half the plants that he still has, plus         2 more. Finally, the thief leaves the nursery with 1 lone palm.

Exercise            Ernest Rutherford published a paper that he described the motion of alpha particles as they are shot at a           piece of gold foil 0.00004 cm thick. Before conducting this experiment, Rutherford expected that the           alpha particles would shoot through the foil just as a bullet would shoot through the foil just as a bullet           would shoot through snow. Instead, a small fraction of the alpha particles bounced off the foil. This led to           the conclusion that the nucleus of an atom is dense, while the remainder of the atom is sparse. Only the           density of the nucleus could cause the alpha particles to deviate from their path. The figure shows a           diagram from Rutherford’s paper that indicates that the deflected alpha particles follow the path of one           branch of a hyperbola.                                  a)  Find an equation of the asymptotes under this scenario.              b)  If the vertex of the path of the alpha particles is 10 cm from the center of the hyperbola, find a                  model that describes the path of the particle.            Solution               a)  Since the particles are deflected at a 45° angle, the asymptotes will be  y = ±    x                b)  Since the vertex is 10 cm from the center of the hyperbola, so  a = 10                                                           b                  The slope of the asymptotes is given by   ±                                                           a                  Therfore:   b  =  1 →  b =  a =  10                              a                               2                   The equation of the particle path is:     x 2  −  y  =  1  ( x ≥  ) 0                                                      100 100                                                                  916","Exercise               Hyperbolas have interesting reflective properties that make them useful for lenses and mirrors. For              example, if a ray of light strikes a convex hyperbolic mirror on a line that would (theoretically) pass              through its rear focus, it is reflected through its rear focus, it is reflected through the front focus. This              property and that of the parabola were used to develop the Cassegrain telescope in 1672. The focus of the              parabolic mirror and the rear focus of the hyperbolic mirror are the same point. The rays are collected by              the parabolic mirror, reflected toward the common focus, and thus are reflected by the hyperbolic mirror              through the opening to its front focus, where the eyepiece is located. If the equation of the hyperbola is               y 2  −  x 2  =  1 and the focal length (distance from the vertex to the focus) of the parabola is 6, find the               9   16              equation of the parabola.

Solution               a)  Given:  n =  30 a = 100 d = −                                                 2                                   1                  a =  100 −  ( 2 n −  ) 1            a =  a +  (n −  ) 1 d                    n                                   n   1                      =  −  2n +  102                   a   = 102 60                            −                    30                      =  42                                                            1002",")                                  +                 b)  S   = 15 (100 42                    S  =  n ( a +  a  )                       30                                 n   2   1    n                          =  2,130                     It required 2130 bricks to build the staircase.                Exercise               A mosaic is designed in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 20 feet on each side. Each tile in the mosaic is              in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 12 inches to a side. The tiles are to alternate in color as shown              below.                                    How many tiles of each color will be required?              Solution                  Bottom row has 20 lighter colored tiles.                 Top row has 1 lighter colored tile.                 The number decreases by 1 as we move up the triangle.                 ∴ This is an arithmetic sequence with: a =  20; d =  −  1; n =  20                                                        1                                 ( )(20 1                  S   =  20 (40 + − 1    −  ))                  S  =  n  2a +   (n −  ) 1 d                    20    2                                        n  2   1                               = 10 (40 19−  )                       = 10 21                          ( )                      = 210                  ∴ There are 210 lighter colored  tiles.                  Bottom row has 19 darker colored tiles.

If you sit too close to           the screen, your viewing angle is too small resulting in a distorted picture. By contrast, if you sit too far           back, the image is quite small, diminishing the movie’s visual impact. If you sit x feet back from the           screen, your viewing angle θ, is giving by                                                    θ =  tan −  1 33  −  tan −  1 8                                                             x         x            Find the viewing angle, in radians, at distances of 5 feet, 10 feet, 15 feet, 25 feet, and 25 feet.

Since radio waves cam              travel over long distances, it is important to control their directional patterns so that radio stations do not              interfere with one another. Suppose that a radio station has two broadcasting towers located along a              north−south line.                                 If the radio station is broadcasting at a wavelength λ and the distance between the two radio towers is                      1              equal to  λ , then the intensity I of the signal in the direction θ is given by                      2                                                    I =  1  I   1 cos π+  ( sinθ  )                                                        2  0                             where  I  is the maximum intensity.                      0                   a)  Approximate I in terms of  I for each θ.                                                  0                       i.   θ =  0               ii.   θ =  π              iii.   θ =  π                                                            3                         7                  b)  Determine the direction in which I has maximum or minimum values.                                                                   1231",")              c)  Graph I on the interval [0, 2  π .

A Mach number is the speed              of the aircraft, in miles per hour, divided by the speed of sound, approximately 740 mph. Thus, a plane              flying at twice the speed of sound has a speed, M, of Mach 2.
