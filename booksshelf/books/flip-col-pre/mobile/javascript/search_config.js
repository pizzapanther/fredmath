The set of all first components of ordered pairs is called the           domain of the relation and the set of second components is called the range of the relation.                                                                                           Domain           Definition of a Function            A function is a relation between two variables such that to            matches each element of a first set (called domain) to an element           of a second set (called range) in such way that no element in the           first set is assigned to two different elements in the second set.           The domain of the function is the set of all values of the           independent variable for which the function is defined.                                    Range            The range of the function is the set of all values taken on by the           dependent variable.

Three straight                cuts can produce a maximum of eight pieces.                                  You might be inclined to think that every additional cut double numbers of pieces. However, for                four straight cuts, you get a maximum of 15 pieces. The maximum number of pieces P that can be                produced by n straight cuts is given by                                                      Pn     n +  3  5n +  6                                                      ( ) =                                                                 6                  a)  Determine number of pieces that can be produces by five straight cuts.                  b)  What is the fewest number of straight cuts that are needed to produce 64 pieces?            73.

The loudness of sounds is measured in a unit called a decibel. To measure with this unit, we first               assign an intensity of  I to a very faint sound, called the threshold sound. If a particular sound has                                     0               intensity I, then the decibel rating of this louder sound is                                                        d = 10log  I                                                                 I                                                                  0               Find the exact decibel rating of a sound with intensity 10,000I                                                                           0                                                                   202","76.

Sal's Shoes and Fred's Footwear both have outlets in California and Arizona. Sal's sells shoes for                   $80, sandals for $40, and boots for $120. Fred's prices are $60, $30, and $150 for shoes, sandals and                   boots, respectively. Half of all sales in California stores are shoes, 1/4 are sandals, and 1/4 are boots.                   In Arizona, the fractions are 1/5 shoes, 1/5 are sandals, and 3/5 are boots.                     a)  Write a 2 x 3 matrix called P representing prices for the two stores and three types of footwear.                     b)  Write a 2 x 3 matrix called F representing fraction of each type of footwear sold in each state.                     c)  Only one of the two products PF and FP is meaningful.

Ernest Rutherford published a paper that he described the motion of alpha particles as they are                   shot at a piece of gold foil 0.00004 cm thick. Before conducting this experiment, Rutherford                   expected that the alpha particles would shoot through the foil just as a bullet would shoot through                   the foil just as a bullet would shoot through snow. Instead, a small fraction of the alpha particles                   bounced off the foil. This led to the conclusion that the nucleus of an atom is dense, while the                   remainder of the atom is sparse. Only the density of the nucleus could cause the alpha particles to                   deviate from their path. The figure shows a diagram from Rutherford’s paper that indicates that                   the deflected alpha particles follow the path of one branch of a hyperbola.                                    a)  Find an equation of the asymptotes under this scenario.                 b)  If the vertex of the path of the alpha particles is 10 cm from the center of the hyperbola, find a                     model that describes the path of the particle.               23.  Hyperbolas have interesting reflective properties that make them useful for lenses and mirrors.                   For example, if a ray of light strikes a convex hyperbolic mirror on a line that would                   (theoretically) pass through its rear focus, it is reflected through its rear focus, it is reflected                   through the front focus. This property and that of the parabola were used to develop the                   Cassegrain telescope in 1672. The focus of the parabolic mirror and the rear focus of the                   hyperbolic mirror are the same point. The rays are collected by the parabolic mirror, reflected                   toward the common focus, and thus are reflected by the hyperbolic mirror through the opening to                                                                                                 y 2  x 2                   its front focus, where the eyepiece is located. If the equation of the hyperbola is   −  =  1 and                                                                                                 9    16                   the focal length (distance from the vertex to the focus) of the parabola is 6, find the equation of                   the parabola.               24.  The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is defined as the number   c  , where a is the distance of a vertex                                                                            a                   from the center and c is the distance of a focus from the center. Because c > a, it follows that                   e > 1 . Describe the general shape of a hyperbola whose eccentricity is close to 1. What is the                   shape if e is very large?                25.  An explosive is recorded by two microphone that are 1 mile apart.

Simultaneous radio signals are sent from each tower to a ship, with the signal from B received                   500 sec  before the signal from A.                       µ                                                                    / sec , determine the equation of the hyperbola                     a)  Assuming that the radio signals travel 300 m µ                        on which the ship is located.                     b)  If the ship lies due north of tower B, how far out at sea is it?               27.

Fred bought a car by taking out a loan for $18,500 at 0.5% interest per month. Fred’s normal                   monthly payment is $434.47 per month, but he decides that he can afford to pay $100 extra toward                   the balance each month. His balance each month is given by the recursively defined sequence                                              B =  $18,500 B =    1.005B     − 534.47                                              0               n         n− 1                      Determine Fred’s balance after making the first payment.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines that Maple Lake has 250 tons of pollutant                   as a result of industrial waste and that 10% of the pollutant present is neuttralized by solar oxidation                   every year. The EPA imposes new pollution control laws that result in 15 tons of new pollutant                   entering the lake each year. The amount of pollutant in the lake after n years is given by the                   recursively defined sequence                                                    P =  250 P =    0.9P    + 15                                                    0          n       n− 1                      Determine the amount of pollutant in the lake after 2 years?

Radio stations often have more than one broadcasting tower because federal guidelines do not                   usually permit a radio station to broadcast its signal in all directions with equal power.

Disregarding the curvature of Earth, as the sun moves lower on the horizon, the distance                that sunlight passes through the atmosphere increases by a factor of cscθ , where θ is the angle of                elevation of the sun.

A common form of cardiovascular branching is bifurcation, in which an artery splits into two                smaller blood vessels. The bifurcation angle θ  is the angle formed by the two smaller arteries.

Throwing events in track and field include the shot put, the discus throw, the hammer throw, and the                javelin throw. The distance that the athlete can achieve depends on the initial speed of the object                thrown and the angle above the horizontal at which the object leaves the hand. This angle is                represented by θ. The distance, d, in feet, that the athlete throws is modeled by the formula                                                          v 2                                                               θ                                                     d =   0  sin cosθ                                                         16                In which v  is the initial speed of the object thrown, in feet per second, and θ is the angle, in                           0                degrees, at which the object leaves the hand.                                                                   504","a)  Use the identity to express the formula so that it contains the since function only.                     b)  Use the formula from part (a) to find the angle, θ, that produces the maximum distance, d, for                        a given initial speed, v .                                              0               50.  The speed of a supersonic aircraft is usually represented by a Mach number. A Mach number is the                   speed of the aircraft, in miles per hour, divided by the speed of sound, approximately 740 mph.                   Thus, a plane flying at twice the speed of sound has a speed, M, of Mach 2.                                   If an aircraft has a speed greater than Mach 1, a sonic boom is heard, created by sound waves that                   form a cone with a vertex angle θ.                                        The relationship between the cone’s vertex angle θ, and the Mach speed, M, of an aircraft that is                   flying faster than the speed of sound is given by                                                             sin θ =  1                                                               2   M                      a)  If θ =  π , determine the Mach speed, M, of the aircraft.
