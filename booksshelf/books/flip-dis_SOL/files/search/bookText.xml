              a)  Boston is the capital of Massachusetts.
              b)  Miami is the capital of Florida
              c)  23 5
                    +=
              d)  5 7 10+=
                      2 11
              e)  x +=
              f)  Answer this question
              g)  Do not pass go
              h)  What time is it?
              i)  The moon is made of green cheese
                    n
              j)  2 ≥  100
             Solution

                a)  This is a true proposition
                b)  This is a false proposition, Tallahassee is the capital

                c)  This is a true proposition
                                                    +=
                d)  This is a false proposition since 57 12 ≠ 10
                e)  This is not a proposition. (The truth value depends on the value assigned to x.)

                f)  This is not a proposition, it is a command
                g)  This is not a proposition; it is a command

                h)  This is not a proposition; it’s a question
                i)  This is a proposition that is false

                j)  This is not a proposition; its truth value depends on the value of n.

          Exercise
          Suppose the Smartphone A has 256 MB RAM and 32 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 8 MP;
          Smartphone B has 288 MB RAM and 64 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 4 MP; Smartphone
          C has 128 MB RAM and 32 GB ROM, and the resolution of its camera is 5 MP. Determine the truth
          value of each of these propositions.
           a)  Smartphone B has the most RAM of these three smartphones
           b)  Smartphone C has more ROM or higher resolution camera than Smartphone B.
           c)  Smartphone B has more RAM, more ROM, and a higher resolution camera than Smartphone A.
           d)  If Smartphone B has more RAM and more ROM than Smartphone C, then it also has a higher
               resolution camera.
           e)  Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B if and only if Smartphone B has more RAM than
               Smartphone A.

          Solution

             a)  This is a true proposition because 288 > 256 and 288 > 128
             b)  This is a true proposition, because the resolution is higher, C has 5 MP resolution compared to B’s
                 4 MP.
             c)  This is not a true proposition. The resolution is not higher that A.

             d)  This is not a true proposition. Not necessary, the resolution in B is not higher that C.
             e)  This is not a true proposition

             Solution

                The proposition  p ↔  is true when  p  and  q  have the same true or false value.  Since  p  and  q  are
                                      q

                truth, then  pq  only true. When  p  and  q  are false, then the negation  p¬  and  q¬  are true, then
                       q
                ¬ p ∧¬  is true. Therefore ( pq∧  ) ( p∨ ¬ ∧¬  ) q  is true only when both are true. Therefore these two
                expressions are logically equivalent.

             The proposition  ( p¬  ↔  ) q  is true when  p ↔  is false. Since  p ↔  is true when  p  and  q  have
             the same truth value, it is false when  p  and  q  have different truth values (either  p  is true and  q  is
                                                                              q

             false in the case which p is true and q is false the proposition is false, and true in the other three cases.
             Therefore these two expressions are logically equivalent.

          Show that  p¬↔  and  p ↔¬  are logically equivalent
          Solution

             The proposition  p¬↔  is true when  p¬  and  q  have the same truth values, which means that  p
                                    q
             and  q  have different truth values (either  p  is true and  q  is false, or vice versa). By the same
                                                                  q
             reasoning, these are exactly the cases in which  p ↔¬ is true. Therefore these two expressions are

             logically equivalent.

             Show that ( p →  q ) ( p∨  →  ) r  and  p →  (qr∨  )  are logically equivalent

             Solution
                ( p →  q ) ( p∨  →  ) r  will be true when either of the conditional statements is true. The conditional

                statement will be true if p is false, or if q in one case or r in the other case is true, when qr∨  is true,
                                             )
                which is precisely  p →  (qr  is true. Since the two propositions are true in exactly the same
                                          ∨
                situation, they are logically equivalent.


             Exercise

             Show that ( p →  r ) (q∨  →  ) r  and ( pq∧  ) →  r  are logically equivalent

             Solution

                In order for ( p →  r ) (q∨  →  ) r to be false, we must have both of the two implications false, which

                happens exactly when r is false and both p and q are true. But this precisely the case in which pq∧  is

                true and r is false, which is ( pq∧  ) →  r  is false. Therefore these two expressions are logically

                equivalent.



             Exercise

             Show that ( p →  q ∧  ) (q →  ) r →  ( p →  ) r  is a tautology

             Solution

                Given that p and  p →  are both true, we conclude that q is true; from that and q →  we conclude
                                      q
                                                                                                  r
                that r is true.



             Exercise

             Show that ( pq∨  ) ( pr∨¬ ∨  ) → (qr∨  ) is a tautology

             Solution

                The conclusion qr∨  will be true in every case except when q and r are both false. But if q and r are
                both false, then one of  pq∨  or  pr¬∨  is false, because one of p or  p¬  is false. Thus in this case

                ( pq∨  ) ( pr∧¬ ∨  )  is false. An conditional statement in which the conclusion is true or the hypothesis
                is false.

                    existence of a multiplication identity for the real numbers, and the statement is true, since we can
                    take  x = 1.

                c)  For every real number x and real number y, if x is nonnegative and y is negative, then the
                    difference  x y−  is positive. More simply, a nonnegative number minus a negative number is
                    positive which is true.

                d)  For every real number x and real number y, if x is positive and y is positive, then the product  xy  is
                    positive. More simply, a product of 2 positive numbers is positive.


                e)  For every real number x and real number y, there exists a real number z such that the product
                         z
                    xy = . More simply, the real numbers are closed under multiplication.

                a)  No matter how large n might be, we can always find an integer m bigger than  n . This is

             If n is odd, then n + 5 is even

             The proof by contradiction assumed that the implication was false, and showed a contradiction
               •  If we assume p and ¬q, we can show that implies q
               •  The contradiction is q and ¬q
               •  Note that both used similar steps, but are different means of proving the implication

             Use a direct proof to show that the sum of two odd integers is even.

             Solution

                Let m and n be two odd integers. Then there exists a and b such that  n =  2a + 1 and  m =  2b + 1.
                            1 2b +

                       =  ( 2 ab++  ) 1

                Since this represents nm+   as 2 times  ab++ 1, we conclude that  nm+   is even, as desired.

          Use a proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is
          irrational.

          Solution

             Let r is a rational number an s is irrational number then t =  rs  is an irrational.
                                                                        +

             Suppose that t is rational, then if t =  a   and  r =  c   where a, b, c, and d are integers with b ≠  and

              t +−     r   sr    s
             Therefore the assumption that t was rational was incorrect, and we conclude that t is irrational.

             if x is rational and  x ≠ , then by definition we can write  x =  , where p and q are nonzero integers.

          numbers. What kind of proof did you use?
          Solution

             Using proof of contradiction, then suppose all the number  a a  ,  , a are less than their average.
                                                                        ,

                                a +  a +    +  a
             By definition:  A =  1   2         n
                                        n
             The two displayed formulas clearly contradict each other, however: they imply that  nA <  nA . Thus
             our assumption must have been incorrect, and we conclude that at least one of the numbers  a  is
                                                                                                       1

                    729 + 729
                None of them works.

             Proof: The only two perfect squares that differ by 1 are 0 and 1
             Thus, any other numbers that differ by 1 cannot both be perfect squares
             Thus, a non-perfect square must exist in any set that contains two numbers that differ by 1

                 output values can be either integers or natural numbers. For example. If the input is 1010000, then
                 one might read the rule as stating that the function value is 3, since there are three more 0s than 1s;
                 but most people would probably consider the function value to be −3, obtained by subtracting in
                 the order stated:  25−= − . Then the range is Z.

             b)  The domain is the set of all bit strings. Since there can be any natural number of 0s in a bit string,
                 the value of the function can be 0, 2, 4, …. Therefore the range is the set of even natural numbers.

          Suppose that g is a function from A to B and f is a function from B to C.
           a)  Show that if both f and g are one−to−one functions, then  f g  is also one−to−one.
           b)  Show that if both f and g are onto functions, then  f g  is also onto.

          Solution

             a)  Assume that both f and g are one−to−one. We need to show that  f g  is also one−to−one. If x
                                                                         ( )) . First, since g is one−to−one, by
                                                              ( )) ≠
                 and y are two distinct elements of A, then  ( fg x   ( fg y
                                                            gx
                                                                      gy
                 definition  ( ) ≠  g ( ) y . Second, since now  ( )  and  ( )  are distinct elements of B, and since
                           gx
                                                                  ( ))  as desired.
                 f is one−to−one, we conclude that  ( fg x     ( fg y
                                                       ( )) ≠

             b)  Assume that both f and g are onto. We need to show that  f g  is onto. If z is any element of C,
                                                                ( )) = . First, since f is onto, we can conclude
                 then there is some element  x∈  such that  ( f gx    z
                                               A
                 that there is an element  y B∈  such that  ( ) = . Second, since g is onto and  y B∈ , we can
                                                                z
                                                        fy
                                                                                                    ( ))  as
                                                                 gx
                                                     A
                                                                        y
                 conclude that there is an element  x∈  such that  ( ) = . therefore  z =  f  ( ) y =  ( f gx
                 desired.

             A person deposits $1,000.00 in an account that yields 9% interest compounded annually.

              c)  How much money will the account contain after 100 years?

             Solution

                a)  The amount after  n − 1 years multiplied by 1.09 to give the amount after n years, since 9% of the
                    value must be added to account for the interest.  Therefore, we have a = 1.09a  . The initial

                b)  Since multiplying by 1.09 for each year, the solution is  a = 1000 (1.09 ) .
                                                                           n

          Suppose that the number of bacteria in a colony triples every hour.

           a)  Set up a recurrence relation for the number of bacteria after n hours have elapsed.
           b)  If 100 bacteria are used to begin new colony, how many bacteria will be in the colony in 10 hours?
          Solution

             a)  Since the number of bacteria triples every hour, the recurrence relation should say that the number
                 of bacteria after n hours is 3 times the number of bacteria after n – 1 hours.
                 Let  a  denote the number of bacteria after n hours, this statement translates into the recurrence

             Solution
                a)  We have one 1 and one 0, then two 1 and two 0, then three of each, and so on increasing the
                    repetition by one each time. Since we have only one at the end, then we need three 1 and four 0 to
                    continue the sequence.
                b)  A pattern is that the positive integers are increasing order, with odd number showing once and
                    each even number repeated.
                    Thus, the next terms are 9, 10, 10.
                                                              65]]></page><page Index="66"><![CDATA[c)  The terms in the odd locations are the successive terms in the geometric sequence that starts with 1

                 2 (n− 1)/2   if n is odd.
                 Thus, the next three terms are 32, 0, 64.

                    Then since x (= 9) is greater than  a  ( 5=  ) , the statement  :i =  m + 1 is executed, so i has the value

                Let s and t are integers such that a =  bs and b =  at .
                 a =  bs =  ats . Since  ≠a  0 , we conclude that  st  = 1.

             Given   a mod  m   ≡    b mod  m      means that a and b have the same remainder a =  q 1 m +  r  and


              b =  q  m + r  for some integer  q  , q and r.

             Assume that  a ≡   ( b  mod  m    ). This means that m − ,  a − b =  mc ⇒  a = b +  mc .

             translating each hexadecimal digit into a block of four binary digits.

          Explain how to convert from binary to base 64 expansions and from base 64 expansions to binary
          expansions and from octal to base 64 expansions and from base 64 expansions to octal expansions

          Solution

                    8
                         2
              64 =  2 = 8 , in base 64 we need 64 symbols, from 0 to up to something representing 63.
             Corresponding to each such symbol would be a binary string of 6 digits, from 000000 for 0 to 001010
             for a, 100011 for z, 100100 for A, 111101 for Z, for 111110 for @, and 111111 for $.
             To translate from binary to base 64, we group the binary digits from the right in groups of 6 and use
             the list of correspondences to replace each 6 bits by one base-64 digits.

             To convert from base 64 to binary, we just replace each base-64 digit by its corresponding 6 bits.
             For conversion between octal and base 64, we change the binary strings in the table to octal strings,
             replacing each 6-bit string by its 2-digit octal equivalent, and then follow the same procedures as
             above, interchanging base-64 digits and 2-digits strings of octal digits.

             Thus we are looking for positive integers less than 30 that have none of these prime factors. Since the

                                                              2
             smallest prime number other than these is 7, and 7  is already greater than 30, in fact only primes
             (and the number 1) will satisfy this condition.
             Therefore the answer is 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 18, 23, and 29.

             We call a positive integer perfect if it equals the sum of its positive divisors other than itself

              a)  Show that 6 and 28 are perfect.

              b)  Show that  2 p− 1 ( 2 − 1  is a perfect number when  2 − 1  is prime
             Solution

                a)  Since  6 = 1+  2 +  3, and these three summands are the only proper divisors of 6, we conclude that
                    6 is perfect.
                    28 = 1+  2 +  4 + 7 + 14 are also the only proper divisors of 28

                    1,  2,  4,  8,  ,  2 p- 1  are proper divisors, and their sum is 2 − 1 (geometric series). Also each of
                                         p
                    these divisors times  2 − 1 is also a divisor, and all but the last is proper. Again adding up this
                                                                 )

                    geometric series we find a sum of 2 p− 1 ( 2 − 1 . There are no other proper divisors. Therefore the
                    sum of all the divisors is

             Solution
                We will prove the assertion by proving its contrapositive.
                Suppose that n is not prime. Then by definition  n =  ab  for some integers a and b each greater than 1.
                Since  a >  1, 2 −  a  1, the first factor in the suggested identity, is greater than 1. The second factor is
                also greater than 1.
                       n
                Thus 2 −=      b   1 is the product of 2 integers each greater than 1, so it is not prime.

          Exercise
          Prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6.
          Solution

             Consider the product  ( nn +  1 )(n +  ) 2  for some integer n.
             Since every second integer is even (divisible by 2), then this product is divisible by 2.
             Since every third integer is divisible by 3, then this product is divisible by 3.
             Therefore, this product has both 2 and 3 in its prime factorization and is therefore divisible by  23 6⋅=

             m, then it divides the right-hand side of this equation, so it also divides b. We can rewrite the equation
             as  a =  b − sm , and they by similar reasoning, we see that every common divisor of b and m is also a

             divisor of a.
             This shows that the set of common divisors of a and m is equal to the set of common divisors of b and

             m, so certainly gcd ( m a,  ) gcd=  ( m b,  )

             Determine which single digit errors are detected by the USPS money order code.

             Solution

                If one digit change to a value not congruent to it modulo 9, then the modular equivalence implied by
                the equation in the preamble will no longer hold. Therefore all single digit errors are detected except

                for the substitution of a 9 for a 0 or vice versa.


             Exercise

             Determine which transposition errors are detected by the USPS money order code.

             Solution
                Because the first ten digits are added, any transposition error involving them will go undetected.
                The sum of the first ten digits will be the same for the transposed number as it is for the correct
                number.
                Suppose that the last digit is transposed with another digit; without loss of generality; we can assume

                it’s the tenth digit and that  x  ≠  x   .
                                            10    11
                Then the correct equation will be

                    x   ≡  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x  (mod    ) 9      ( ) 1
                     11    1    2    3    4    5    6     7    8    9    10
                But the equation resulting from the error will read
                    x   ≡  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x +  x  (mod    ) 9      ( ) 2
                     10    1    2    3    4     5    6    7    8    9    11

                Subtract equations ( ) 2  & ( ) 1

                    x   −  x  ≡  x  −  x  (mod   ) 9
                     11    10    10    11
                    2x   ≡  2x  (mod    ) 9             Divide by 2 both sides since 2 is prime
                       11     10
                    x   ≡  x  (mod   ) 9   Which is false
                     11    10
                The check equation will fail.
                Therefore, we conclude that transposition errors involving the eleventh digits are detected.

        Exercise

        A pile of n rings, each smaller than the one below it, is on a peg on board. Two other pegs are attached to
        the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings must be moved, one at a time, to a
        different peg with no ring ever placed on top of a smaller ring. Find the least number of moves that would
        be required. Prove your result by mathematical induction.
        Solution

            With 1 ring, 1 move is required.

        Give a recursive definition of
              a)  The set of odd positive integers
              b)  The set of positive integers powers of 3
              c)  The set of polynomial with integer coefficients
              d)  The set of even integers
              e)  The set of positive integers congruent to 2 modulo 3.
              f)  The set of positive integers  not divisible by 5

        Solution
            a)  Off integers are obtained from other odd integers by adding 2.
               Thus, we can define this set S as follows 1 S∈ ; and if  n S, then    n∈  +∈
                                                                                    2 S .
            b)  Powers of 3 are obtained from other powers of 3 by multiplying by 3.
               Thus, we can define this set S as follows 3 S∈ ; and if  nS, then   ∈  3nS∈  .

            c)  There are several ways to do this. One that is suggested by Horner’s method is as follows. We
                                                                                                 px
               assume that the variable for these polynomials is the letter x. All integers are in S; if  ( ) S∈  and n
                                   xp
                                           n
               is any integer, then  ( ) x +  is in S.
               Another method constructs the polynomials term by term. Its base case is to let 0 be in S; and its
               inductive step is to say that if  ( ) S∈ , c is an integer, and n is a nonnegative integer, then
                                             px
                         n
                p ( ) x + cx  is in S.

            d)  Off integers are obtained from other even integers by adding 2.
                                                                                    2 S   and   n+
               Thus, we can define this set S as follows  2 S∈ ; and if  n S, then    n∈  −∈       2 S∈ .
            e)  The smallest positive integer congruent to 2 modulo 3 is 2, so 2 S∈ . All the others can be obtained
               by adding multiples of 3, so the inductive step is that  n S, then    n∈  +∈
                                                                                   3 S
            f)  The positive integers no divisible by 5 are the ones congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5.
                                                                                ∈
               Thus, we can define this set S as follows 1 S,∈  2∈  S,  3 ∈  S,  and  4 S ; and if
                                5 S
                 ∈
                n S, then    n+∈

        How many 4-permutations of the positive integers not exceeding 100 contain three consecutive integers, k,
        k + 1, k + 2, in the order

          a)  Where these consecutive integers can perhaps be separated by other integers in the permutation?
          b)  Where they are in consecutive positions in the permutation?
        Solution

            a)  The consecutive numbers are 5, 6, 7, since can be separate by other integers the permutation can be
               written as 5, 6, 32, 7.
               In order to specify such 4-permutation, we need to choose 3 consecutive integers. They can be {1,
               2, 3} to (98, 99, 100}; thus, there are 98 possibilities. There are 4 possibilities, we need to decide
               which 97 other positive integers not exceeding 100 is to fill this slot, and there are 97 choices.
               In fact, every 4-permutation consisting of 4 consecutive numbers, in order, has been double
               counted.
               Therefore, we need to subtract the number of such 4-permutations. Clearly there are 97 of them.
               Further thought shows that every other 4-permutation in our collection arises in a unique way.
               Therefore  98 4 97 97 =⋅⋅  −  37,927

            b)  The consecutive numbers be consecutive in the 4-permutation.
               There are only 2 places to put the fourth number in slot 1 and slot 4.
               Therefore, 98 2 97 97 =⋅⋅  −  18,915

            a)  This can be done 6 ways. We need to choose the vowel and this can be done in 5 ways. Each other 5
                                                                            5
               positions can contain any of the 21 consonants, so there are  21  ways to fill the rest of the string.

               Therefore, the answer is 6 5 21  ⋅ ⋅  5  = 122,5 33 30 ways
            b)  The position of the vowels can be done in  (6, 2C     ) 15 ways=  . We need to choose the 2 vowels in
                                                                                                  4
                 2
                5  ways. Each other 4 positions can contain any of the 21 consonants, so there are  21  ways to fill
               the rest of the string.
                                                 4

             a)  Find a recurrence relation for the number of bit strings of length n that contain three consecutive 0s.
             b)  What are the initial conditions?
             c)  How many bit strings of length seven contain three consecutive 0s?

             Solution

                a)  Let  a  be the number of bit strings of length n containing three consecutive 0’s. In order to
                         n
                    construct a bit string of length n containing three consecutive 0’s we could start with 1 and follow
                    with a string of length n – 1 three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 01 and follow with a
                    string of length n – 2 three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 001 and follow with a string of

                    These 4 cases are mutually exclusive and exhaust the possibilities for how the string might start. We

               n – 1 not containing three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with 01 and follow with a string of
               length n – 2 not containing three consecutive 0’s, or we could start with a 001 and follow with a

               These 3 cases are mutually exclusive and exhaust the possibilities for how the string might start
               since it cannot start 000.
               We can write down the recurrence relation, valid for all  n ≥  3: a =  a  +  a  +  a
                                                                               n    n −  1  n −  2  n −  3

             a)  Find a recurrence relation for the number of ways to climb n stairs if the person climbing the stairs can
                take one stair or two stairs at a time.
             b)  What are the initial conditions?
             c)  In how many can this person climb a flight of eight stairs

             Solution
                a)  Let  a  be the number of ways to climb n stairs. In order to climb n stairs, a person must either start
                         n
                                                                (
                    with a step of one stair and climb n – 1 stairs   a n− 1 )  or else start with a step of two stairs and then
                                                                                                           (
                                     (
                    climb n – 2 stairs  a n− 2 )  or else start with a step of two stairs and then climb n – 3 stairs  a n− 3 ) .
                    From this analysis we can immediately write down the recurrence relation, valid for all
                    n ≥  3: a =  a    +  a   +  a
                             n    n−  1  n−  2   n−  3

                b)  The initial conditions are  a = 1, a = 1 and   a =   2, since there is one way to climb no stairs
                                              0        1             2
                    (do nothing), clearly only one way to climb one stair, and two ways to climb stairs (one step twice
                    or two steps at once).

                                              { }
                c)  Each term in our sequence  a n   is the sum of the previous three terms, so the sequence begins

                    a =  1,  a = 1,  a =  2,  a =  4,  a = 7,  a = 13,  a = 24,  a =  44,  a = 81

                    Thus, a person can climb a flight of 8 stairs in 81 ways under the restrictions in this problem.

             How many different messages can be transmitted in n microseconds using three different signals if one
             signal requires 1 microsecond for transmittal, the other two signals require 2 microseconds each for
             transmittal, and a signal in a message is followed immediately by the next signal?

             Solution

                The characteristic polynomial is r −−   20
                So, the roots are −1, and 2

                Plugging in initial conditions gives
                    1 α =  ( ) 1−  0  α +  2 0  →  1 α =  α +

             In how many ways can a  2 n×  rectangular checkerboard be tiled using 12×  and  22×  pieces?

                                                               175]]></page><page Index="176"><![CDATA[Let t  be the number of ways like to tile a  2 n×  board with 12×  and  22×  pieces. To obtain the
                 n
            recurrence relation, imagine what tiles are placed at the left-hand end of the board. We can place a  22×

            tile there, leaving a  2×  (n −  ) 2 board to be tiled, which of course can be done in t n− 2  ways.
            We can place a 12×  tile at the edge, oriented vertically, leaving  2×  (n −  ) 1  board to be tiled, which of

            course can be done in t   ways.
                                  n− 1
            Finally, we can place two 12×  tiles horizontally, one above the other, leaving a   2×  (n −  ) 2  board to be

            tiled, which of course can be done in t  ways. These 3 possibilities are disjoint.

             Determine whether the relation R on the set of all people is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, and/or

             transitive, where ( , a b ) R∈  if and only if
              a)  a is taller than b.
              b)  a and b were born on the same day
              c)  a has the same first name as b.
              d)  a and b have a common grandparent.

             Solution

                a)  I am not taller than myself, therefore being taller is not reflexive
                    It is not symmetric, since I am taller than my kid but my kid is not
                    It is antisymmetric since we never have a taller than b and b taller than a even if a = b
                    It is transitive since if a taller than b and b taller than c that implies that A taller then c
                b)  The relation is reflexive since a is born on the same day
                    It is symmetric, since a and b were born on the same day
                    It is not antisymmetric since a and b were born on the same day but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a and b were born on the same day and b and c were born on the same day
                    that implies that a and c were born on the same day

                c)  The relation is reflexive since a has the same first name as a
                    It is symmetric, since a has the same first name as b than b has the same first name as a

                    It is not antisymmetric since a has the same first name as b but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a has the same first name as b and c has the same first name as c that
                    implies that a has the same first name as c

                d)  The relation is reflexive since a and a have a common grandparent
                    It is symmetric, since a and b have a common grandparent than b and a have a common
                    grandparent
                    It is not antisymmetric since a and b have a common grandparent but a  ≠ b
                    It is transitive since if a and b have a common grandparent and b and c have a common
                    grandparent that implies that a and c have a common grandparent

             Solution
                a)  This relation is not reflexive, since 1 ≠ 1 for instance
                    It is symmetric, if  x ≠  y ⇒  y ≠  x

                    It is not antisymmetric since 1 2≠ ⇒ 21

                    It is not transitive since 1 2 and ≠  2 1≠⇒ 11
                b)  This relation is not reflexive, since (0, 0) is not included  0 ≥ (  ) 1

                    It is symmetric, because  xy =  yx (commutative property of multiplication)
                    It is not antisymmetric since (2, 3) and (3, 2) are both included
                    It is transitive holds between x and y if and only if either x and y are both positive or x and y are
                    both negative

                c)  This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) is not included (1 1≠ +  ) 1
                                                                        x
                    It is symmetric, because  x = − 1 is equivalent to  y = + 1
                                                y
                    It is not antisymmetric since (1, 2) and (2, 1) are in the relation
                    It is not transitive since (1, 2) and (2, 1) are in the relation but (1, 1) is not

                    It is symmetric since is  x  ≡  ( y mod  ) 7  then  x y−= 7t , therefore  yx−=  7 ( ) t−  so  y  ≡  ( x mod  ) 7

                    It is transitive since  x  ≡  ( y mod  ) 7  means  x y−= 7t  and  y  ≡  ( z mod  ) 7  means  yz  7s
                    x y−=  x y +−  yz =−  7t + 7s =  ( 7 t s+  ) ; therefore  x  ≡  ( z mod  ) 7

          Exercise

          Let R be the relation on the set of all states in the U.S. consisting of pairs (a, b) where state a borders state
          b. Find

                 a)  R − 1     b)   R
          Solution

             a)  Since this relation is symmetric,  R − 1  =  R

             b)  This relation consists of all pairs (a, b) in which state a does not border state b.

          Exercise

          Let R be the relation on the set {0, 1, 2, 3} containing the ordered pairs (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0),
          (2, 2), and (3, 0).  Find the
             a)  Reflexive closure of R.
             b)  Symmetric closure of R.

          Solution
             a)  The reflexive closure of R is R with all (a, a). In this case the closure of R is
                 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3)}


             b)  The symmetric closure of R is R with (b, a) for which (a, b) is in R.
                 In this case the symmetric of R is
                 {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0) (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,0), (2, 1) (2, 2), (3, 0)}

          Let R be the relation  ( { ,a b a ≠  } b  on the set of integers. What is the reflexive closure of R?
          Solution

             When we add all the pairs (x, x) to the given relation we have all of  Z×Z, which the relation will
             always holds.

          Let R be the relation  ( { , a  b a divides b  on the set of integers. What is the symmetric closure of R?
                                    ) |
          Solution

             To form the symmetric closure, we need to add all the pairs (b, a) such that (a, b) is in R.
             We need to include pairs (b, a) such that a divides b, which is equivalent to saying that we need to
             include all the pairs (a, b) such that b divides a.
             Thus the closure is {(a, b) | a divides b or b divides a}


          Exercise

          How can the directed graph representing the reflexive closure of a relation on a finite set be constructed
          from the directed graph of the relation?
          Solution

             To form a reflexive closure, we simply need to add a loop at each vertex that does not already have
             one.

                a)  This relation is reflexive, since a is the same person (same age).
                    If a is the same age as b, then b has to be the same age as a. this relation is symmetric.
                    If a is the same age as b and b is the same age as c,  then a has to be the same age as c. this relation
                    is transitive.
                    An equivalence class is the set of all people who are the same age. To really identify the
                    equivalence class and the equivalence relation itself, one would need to specify exactly what ine
                    meant by the  “same age”. For example, we could define two people to be the same age if their
                    official dates of birth were identical.
                b)  For each pair (m, w) of a man and a woman, the set of offspring of their union, if nonempty, is an
                    equivalence class. In many cases, then, an equivalence class consists of all the children in a
                    nuclear family with children.
                c)  Let assume the relation is biological parentage. It is possible that a to be the the child of W and X,
                    b is the child of X and Y, and c is the child of Y and Z.  Then a is related to b, and b is related to c,

          the relations discussed in the text. Determine the equivalence classes for each of these equivalence
          relations.

             One relation is that a and b are related if they were born in the same state. Here the equivalence
             classes are the nonempty sets of students from each state.

             Define three equivalence relations on the set of buildings on a college campus. Determine the equivalence
             classes for each of these equivalence relations.

             Solution

                Two buildings are equivalent, if they were opened during the same year; an equivalence class consists
                of the set of buildings opened in a given year.
                For another example, we can define 2 buildings to be equivalent if they have the same number of
                stories; the equivalence classes are the set of 1-story buildings, the set of 2-story buildings, and so on.
                The third example, partition the set of all buildings into 2 classes – those in which you do have a class
                this semester and those in which you don’t. Every building in which you have a class is equivalent to
                every building in which you have a class (including itself), and every building in which you don’t
                have a class is equivalent to every building in which you don’t have a class.

             Let R be the relation on the set of all sets of real numbers such that S R T if and only if S and T have the
             same cardinality. Show that R is an equivalence relation. What are the equivalence classes of the sets {0,
             1, 2} and  Z ?
             Solution

                Two sets have the same cardinality if there is a bijection (1−1 and onto function) from one set to the
                other.
                We need to prove that R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
                Every set has the same cardinality as itself because of the identity function.

                If f is a bijection from S to T, then  f  − 1  is a bijection from T tot S, so R is symmetric.
                If f is a bijection from S to T, and g is a bijection from T to U, then  g f   is a bijection from S to U, so
                R is transitive.
                The equivalence class {1, 2, 3} is the set of all 3-element sets of real numbers, including such sets as

          Solution

             a)  This relation is reflexive because each of 0, 1, 2, 3 is related to itself.
                 This relation is antisymmetric because a to be related to b is for a to be equal to b
                 Since a is related to b and b related to c and  abc= = , then a is related to c. So the relation is
                 transitive.
                 The equality relation on any set satisfies all three conditions, therefore is a partial ordering.

             b)  It is reflexive but it is not antisymmetric since we have  23R  and 32R  but  23.
                                                                                          ≠
                 Therefore, this is not a partial ordering.

                h)  a and b do not have a common friend?
             Solution

                a)  Since nobody is taller than himself, this relation is not reflexive, so (S, R) is not a poset.


                b)  To be not a taller means exactly the same height or shorter. 2 different people x and y could have
                    the same height, in which case  xRy and  yRx  but x ≠  y , so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                c)  The equality clause in the given of R guarantees that R is reflexive.
                    If a is ancestor to b, then b can’t be ancestor to a, so the relation is vacuously antisymmetric.
                    If a is ancestor to b and b is ancestor to c, then a is ancestor to c, thus R is transitive.
                    Therefore, this relation is a poset.
                d)  Let x and y be any 2 distinct friends,  xRy and  yRx  but x ≠  y , so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                e)  Let 2 people can be the same height since are not the same person, so R is not antisymmetric.
                    Therefore, this relation is not a poset.

                f)  Since nobody is weight more than himself, this relation is not reflexive, so this relation is not a

          there is an edge associated to { ,u v  is a symmetric, irreflexive relation on G.
          Solution

             In a simple graph, edges are undirected.

             If uRv , then there is edge associated with { ,u v . But { ,u  v } { ,v u=  } , so this edge is associated with

             { ,v u  and, therefore. So, R is symmetric.
                                                                                              }
             A simple graph does not allow loops; that is if there is an edge associated with { ,u v , then u ≠ .

             Exercise

             Explain how graphs can be used to model electronic mail messages in a network. Should the edges be
             directed or undirected? Should multiple edges be allowed? Should loops be allowed? Describe a graph
             that models the electronic mail sent in a network in a particular week.

             Solution

                We can have a vertex for each mailbox or e-mail address in the network, with a directed edge between
                two vertices if a message is sent from the tail of the edge to the head.
                We use directed edge for each message sent during the week.

                If it did, then certainly the circuit would have to contain edges {d, a} and {a, b}, since these are the
                only edges incident to vertex a. By the same reasoning, the circuit would have to contain the other six
                edges around the outside of the figure. These 8 edges already complete a circuit, and this circuit omits
                the 9 vertices on the inside.
                Therefore, there is no Hamilton circuit.

          Imagine that the drawing below is a map showing 4 cities and the distances in kilometers between them.
          Suppose that a salesman must travel to each city exactly once, starting and ending in city A. Which route
          from city to city will minimize the total distance that must be traveled?










          Solution

                   Route           Total Distance (Km)

                  ABCDA         30 + 30 + 25 + 40 = 125
                  ABDCA         30 + 35 + 25 + 50 = 140

                  ACBDA         50 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 155
                  ACDBA         50 + 25 + 35 + 30 = 140
                  ADBCA         40 + 35 + 30 + 50 = 155
                  ADCBA         40 + 25 + 30 + 30 = 125

             Thus either route ABCDA or ADCBA fives the minimum total distance of 125 km.
