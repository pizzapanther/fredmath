        A cyclist pedals along a straight road with velocity  ( ) t =  2t −  2  8t +  6   (mi  / hr )  for 0 t≤≤ , where t is
        measured in hours.
          a)  Graph the velocity function over the interval [0, 3]. Determine when the cyclist moves in the position
              direction and when she moves in the negative direction.
          b)  Find the displacement of the cyclist (in miles) on the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [0, 3]. Interpret
              these results.
          c)  Find the distance traveled over the interval [0, 3]

               The velocity is zero at t = 1 and t = 3.

               The velocity is positive on 0 t≤< 1, which means the cyclist moves in the positive s direction.

               The velocity is negative on 1 t<< , which means the cyclist moves in the negative s direction.

            A curved wedge is cut from a circular cylinder of radius 3 by two planes. One plane is perpendicular to the

           axis of the cylinder. The second place crosses the first plane at a 45° angle at the center of the cylinder. Find

               The base of the cylinder is a circle  x +  2  y =  2  9 .
               Since the second plane cut the base at the cylinder at the center, therefore, the base of the wedge is semi-

        Density and Mass

        Density is the concentration of mass in an object and is usually measured in units of mass per volume. An
        object with uniform density satisfies the basic relationship
                                                      =
                                                                ⋅
                                                mass density volume
        When density of an object varies, this formula no longer holds, and we must appeal to calculus.

        Work Done By a Constant Force

        When a body moves a distance d along a straight line as a result of being acted on by a force of constant
        magnitude F in the direction of motion, we define the work W done by the force on the body with the
        formula
                                                              ⋅
                                                 Work =  force distance
                                                W =  Fd   (Constant-force formula for work)

        The unit of work is a newton-meter (N.m), also called joule.

             Hooke’s Law for Springs: F = kx


             Hooke’s Law says that the force required to hold a stretched or compressed spring x units from its natural

             Dams are built thicker at the bottom than at the top because the pressure against them increases with depth

             Financial Model


             The balance in the account increases exponentially at a rate that can be determined from the advertised
             annual percentage yield (or APY) of the account.


             Effective Rate

             The effective rate corresponding to a started rate of interest r compounded m times per year is

                                                                 r
                                                        r =  e  ( 1+  m ) m  −  1
             APY is also referred to as effective rate or true interest rate.


             Example

             The APY of a savings account is the percentage increase in the balance over the course of a year. Suppose
             you deposit $500 in a savings account that has an APY of 6.18% per year. Assume that the interest rate
             remains constant and that no additional deposits or withdrawals are made. How long will it take the balance
             to reach $2500?

             Relationship Between Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions

             The trigonometric functions are based on relationships involving a circle, also known as circular functions.

             Specifically, cost  and sin t  are equal to x- and y-coordinates, respectively, of the point  ( ,P xy  on the unit

             circle that corresponds to an angle of t radians.
























             Observe that t is twice the area of the circular sector.
             The hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are defined in analogous fashion using the hyperbola

             x −  2  y =  2  1 instead the circle  x +  2  y =  2  1.
