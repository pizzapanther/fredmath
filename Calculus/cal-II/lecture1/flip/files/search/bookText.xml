          A cyclist pedals along a straight road with velocity  ( ) t =  2t −  2  8t +  6   (mi  / hr )  for 0 t≤≤ , where t is
          measured in hours.
           a)  Graph the velocity function over the interval [0, 3]. Determine when the cyclist moves in the
               position direction and when she moves in the negative direction.
           b)  Find the displacement of the cyclist (in miles) on the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [0, 3]. Interpret
               these results.

                 The velocity is zero at t = 1 and t = 3.

                 The velocity is positive on 0 t  1, which means the cyclist moves in the positive s direction.

          Suppose a skydiver leaps from a hovering helicopter and fall in a straight line. He falls at a terminal
          velocity of 80 m/s for 19 sec, at which time he opens his parachute. The velocity decreases linearly to 6

          m/s over two-second period and then remains constant until he reaches the ground at t = 40 s. The motion

             An artillery shell is fired directly upward with an initial velocity of
             300 m/s from a point 30 m above the ground. Assume that only the
             force of gravity acts on the shell and it produces an acceleration of

                The velocity decreases from its initial value of 300 m/s, reaching zero at the high point of the

                At this point the velocity becomes negative, and the shell begins its descent to Earth.

           A curved wedge is cut from a circular cylinder of radius 3 by two planes. One plane is perpendicular to

          the axis of the cylinder. The second place crosses the first plane at a 45° angle at the center of the
          cylinder. Find the volume of the wedge.
          Solution


             The base of the cylinder is a circle  x +  2  y =  2  9 .
             Since the second plane cut the base at the cylinder at the center, therefore, the base of the wedge is


             semi-circle.  y =  ±  9 x−  2  =  radius .
             When we slice the wedge by a plane perpendicular to the axis
             of the cylinder, we obtained a cross-section at x which is a
             rectangle of height x.
             The area of this cross-section is:

                               ×

             If the region we revolved to generate a solid does not border on or cross the axis of revolution, the solid
             has a hole in it. The cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of revolution are washers instead of disks.
             The dimensions of a typical washer are:

             Density and Mass

             Density is the concentration of mass in an object and is usually measured in units of mass per volume. An
             object with uniform density satisfies the basic relationship
                                                    mass =  density volume⋅

             When density of an object varies, this formula no longer holds, and we must appeal to calculus.

             Dams are built thicker at the bottom than at the top because the pressure against them increases with depth

             Pressure is a force per unit area, measured in units such as  Nm .

             Exponential growth is described by functions of the form  ( ) =  y  ( ) t e . The initial value of y at t =

             is  ( ) 0y  =  y  and the rate constant  k >  determines the rate of the growth. Exponential growth is
                        0
             characterized by a constant relative growth rate.


             Example

             Suppose the population of the town of Pine is given by  ( ) 1500 125P t =  +  t , while the population of the

             town of Spruce is given by  ( ) 1500e  0.1t  , where t ≥  is measured in years. Find the growth rate and
                                                                   0
                                       S t =
             the relative growth rate of each town.
             Solution

                 dP  = 125
                 dt
                 dS  = 150e 0.1t
                 dt
                The relative growth rate of Pine is
                 1 dP  =    125      , which decreases in time.
                 P dt   1500 125t+
                The relative growth rate of Spruce is

                 1 dS  =  150e 0.1t   = 0.1     Contant for all times
                 S dt   1500e 0.1t
                The linear population function has a constant absolute growth rate and the exponential population
                function has a constant relative growth rate.

             The balance in the account increases exponentially at a rate that can be determined from the advertised
             annual percentage yield (or APY) of the account.


             Effective Rate

             The effective rate corresponding to a started rate of interest r compounded m times per year is

                                                                r

             APY is also referred to as effective rate or true interest rate.


             Example

             The APY of a savings account is the percentage increase in the balance over the course of a year. Suppose
             you deposit $500 in a savings account that has an APY of 6.18% per year. Assume that the interest rate
