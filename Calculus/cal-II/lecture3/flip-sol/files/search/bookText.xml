        Many people take aspirin on a regular basis as a preventive measure for heart disease. Suppose a person take
        80 mg of aspirin every 24 hr. Assume also that aspirin has a half-life of 24 hr; that is, every 24 hr half of the
        drug in the blood is eliminated.

        The Greeks solved several calculus problems almost 2000 years before the discovery of calculus. One
        example is Archimedes’ calculation of the area of the region R bounded by a segment of a parabola, which
        he did using the “method of exhaustion”.
        The idea was to fill R with an infinite sequence of triangles. Archimedes began with an isosceles triangle
        inscribed in the parabola, with an area  A , and proceeded in stages, with the number of new triangles
                                               1
        doubling at each stage. He was able to show (the key to the solution) that at each stage, the area of a new
                   1
        triangle is   of the area of a triangle at the previous stage; for example,  A =  1  A , and so forth. Show, as
                   8                                                            2   8  1

        Archimedes did, that the area of R is   times the area of  A .

        Exercise

        Suppose you borrow $20,000 for a new car at a monthly interest rate of 0.75%. If you make payments of
        $600/month, after how many months will the loan balance be zero? Estimate the answer by graphing the
        sequence of loan balances and then obtain an exact answer using infinite series.

        An insulated windows consists of two parallel panes of glass with a small spacing between them. Suppose

        that each pane reflects a fraction p of the incoming light and transmits the remaining light. Considering all
        reflections of light between the panes, what fraction of the incoming light is ultimately transmitted by the
        windows? Assume the amount of incoming light is 1.

           Solution

               a)  Triangle has 3 equal sizes, from  I  to  I  each side turn into 4, and so on.
                                                   0     1

                   I    is obtained by  I  by dividing each edge into 3 equal parts, removing the middle part, and
                    n+ 1               n
                  adding 2 parts equal to it. Thus 3 equal parts turn into 4, so  L  =  4 L
                                                                             n+ 1  3 n

                  This is a geometric series with a ratio greater than 1, so the n  term grows without bound.

            b)  From part (a)  I  has 34 ⋅  n  sides of length   1  ; each of those sides turns into an added triangle in

           It can be proved that if a series converges absolutely, then its terms may be summed in any order without
           changing the value of the series. However, if a series converges conditionally, then the value of the series
           depends on the order of summation. For example, the (conditionally convergent) alternating harmonic series
           has the value

                                                    1−  1  +  1  −  1  +  =  ln2

           Exercise

           A crew of workers is constructing a tunnel through a mountain. Understandably, the rate of construction
           decreases because rocks and earth must be removed a greater distance as the tunnel gets longer. Suppose that
           each week the crew digs 0.95 of the distance it dug the previous week. In the first week, the crew constructed
           100 m of tunnel.
             a)  How far does the crew dig in 10 weeks? 20 weeks? N weeks?
             b)  What is the longest tunnel the crew can build at this rate?
             c)  The time required to dig 100 m increases by 10% each week, starting with 1 week to dig the first 100 m.
                 Can the crew complete a 1.5 km tunnel in 10 weeks? Explain.

               c)  The series can be seen to diverge because the even partial sums have limit ∞.
                  This does not contradict the alternating series test because the terms  a  are not nonincreasing.

        The concentration in the blood resulting from a single dose of a drug normally decreases with time as the
        drug is eliminated from the body. Doses may therefore need to be repeated periodically to keep the
        concentration from dropping below some particular level. One model for the effect of repeated doses gives

        the residual concentration just before the (n +  ) 1 st  does as

        Exercise

        If a drug is known to be ineffective below a concentration C  and harmful above some higher concentration
                                                                  L
         C   , one needs to find values of C  and t  that will produce a concentration that is safe (not above C  )
          H                               0       0                                                         H
        but effective (not below C ).
                                  L

















        We therefore want to find values for C  and t for which
                                              0      0

                             L          0         H
        Thus C =   C    − C . The resulting equation simplifies to
                0    H     L

                                  L
        To reach an effective level rapidly, one might administer a “loading” dose that would produce a
        concentration of C    mg  / mL. This could be followed every t hours by a dose that raises the concentration
                           H                                         0
        by C =   C   − C   mg  / mL .
             0     H     L
            a)  Verify the preceding equation for t .

            b)  If  k = 0.05  h − 1  and the highest safe concentration is e times the lowest effective concentration, find
               the length of time between doses that will assure safe and effective concentrations.

        Suppose you want to approximate  128  to within 10  − 4  of the exact value.
            a)  Use a Taylor polynomial for  ( ) (125f x =  +  ) x  1/3  centered at 0.
