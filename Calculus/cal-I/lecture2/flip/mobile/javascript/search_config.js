A port and a radar station are 2 mi apart on a straight shore running east and west. A ship leaves the                port at noon traveling northeast at a rate of 15 mi/hr. If the ship maintains its speed and course, what                is the rate of change of the tracking angle θ between the shore and the line between the radar station                and the ship at 12:30 PM?                                                                               158","81.  A ship leaves port traveling southwest at a rate of 12 mi/hr. At noon, the ship reaches its closest                   approach to a radar station, which is on the shore 1.5 mi from the port. If the ship maintains its speed                   and course, what is the rate of change of the tracking angle θ between the radar station and the ship                   at 1:30 PM?                              82.  A lighthouse stands 500 m off of a straight shore, the focused beam of its light revolving four times                   each minute. P is the point on shore closest to the lighthouse and Q is a point on the shore 200 m                   from P.                                     a)  What is the speed of the beam along the shore when it strikes the point Q?                     b)  Describe how the speed of the beam along the shore varies with the distance between P and Q.

At the same time, another boat leaves the same                    port traveling northeast at 15 mi/hr. The angle θ of the line between the boats is measured relative to                   due north.  What is the rate of change of this angle 30 min. after the boats leave the port? 2 hr. after                   the boats leave the port?                               84.  An observer stands 20 m from the bottom of a 10-m tall Ferris wheel on a line that is perpendicular                   to the face of the Ferris wheel. The wheel revolves at a rate of π rad/min and the observer’s line of                   sight with a specific seat on the wheel makes an angle θ  with the ground. 40 seconds after that seat                   leaves the lowest point on the wheel, what is the rate of change of θ ?                                                               159","Assume the observer’s eyes are level with the bottom of the wheel.                              85.  The bottom of a large theater screen is 3 ft. above your eye level and the top of the screen is 10 ft.                above your eye level. Assume you walk away from the screen (perpendicular to the screen) at a rate                of 3 ft/s while looking at the screen. What is the rate of change of the viewing angle θ  when you are                30 ft. from the wall on which the screen hangs, assuming the floor is flat?                              86.  A revolving searchlight, 100 m from the nearest point on the center line of a straight highway, casts                a horizontal beam along a highway. The beam leaves the spotlight at an angle of   π  rad and                                                                                              16                 revolves at a rate   π  rad/s.

A piston is seated at the top of a cylindrical chamber with radius 5 cm when it starts moving into the                   chamber at a constant speed of 3 cm/sec. What is the rate of change of the volume of the cylinder                   when the piston is 2 cm from the base of the chamber?                                                                                                                                                  161","162"];
