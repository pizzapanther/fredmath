Several mathematical stories originated with the second wedding                   of the mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler. Here is                   one: while shopping for wine for his wedding, Kepler noticed                   that the price of a barrel of wine (here assumed to be a cylinder)                   was determined solely by the length d of a dipstick that was                   inserted diagonally through a hole in the top of the barrel to the                   edge of the base of the barrel.                   Kepler realized that this measurement does not determine the                   volume of the barrel and that for a fixed value of d, the volume                    varies the radius r and height h of the barrel. For a fixed value of                   d, what is the ratio r/h that maximizes the volume of the barrel?                                                                 203","78.
