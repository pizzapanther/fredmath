Here is one: while shopping for wine for his wedding, Kepler noticed that the price of a           barrel of wine (here assumed to be a cylinder) was determined solely by the length d of a dipstick that was           inserted diagonally through a hole in the top of the barrel to the edge of the base of the barrel.            Kepler realized that this measurement does not determine the volume of the barrel and that for a fixed           value of d, the volume varies the radius r and height h of the barrel. For a fixed value of d, what is the           ratio r/h that maximizes the volume of the barrel?
