          3.1−2  Theorem − The Extreme Value Theorem



          If  f  is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then  f  attains both an absolute maximum value M and
          an absolute minimum value m in [a, b]. That is, there are numbers  x  and  x  in [a, b] with

                 An absolute maximum is also a local maximum. Being the largest value overall, it is also the largest
                 value in its immediate neighborhood.

               inscribed in a right circular cone with a height of h feet and a base with radius r feet.

















                 a)  Write the volume of the rectangular box as a function of x where h and r are constants.
                 b)  What values of x and y will give the box the largest possible volume when cone with a
                    height of 10 feet and a base with radius 6 feet?

          129.  An ice cream cone with a height of one unit holds a sphere of ice cream. What is the radius of
               the ice cream sphere that maximizes the amount of the ice cream inside the cone?

               You can see why this question results in an optimization problem: If the radius is small, much
               of the sphere is inside the cone, but the volume of the sphere is small. Alternatively, if the
               radius is large, the volume of the sphere is large, but only a small fraction of the sphere is inside
               the cone. Somewhere between these extremes, there should an optimal radius.




















               We assume that the cone has a base angle of 2θ and that the ice cream sphere is tangent to the
               sides of the cone. The solution requires the formula for the volume of a spherical cap. A cap of
               height h sliced from a sphere of radius r has volume of

                      To optimize the problem from the given information is to find a function. In this case, the
                      objective function is the volume of the ice cream sphere that is inside the cone. Two cases must
                      be considered. Let a be the distance between the center of the sphere and the top edge of the
                      cone, where a > 0 means the center is below the top of the cone and a < 0 means the center is
                      below the top of the cone.

                        a)  In the case that a > 0, show that  r =  (1 a+  )sinθ . (The line from the center of the sphere

                            to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the cone.)
                        b)  In the case that a > 0, show that the volume of ice cream inside the cone is

                        c)  In the case that a < 0, show that  r =  (1−  a  ) sinθ  (1 a )sinθ =  , which is the same
                            relationship as in the case that a > 0.
                        d)  For a < 0, show that the volume of the ice cream inside the cone is

                            Vr     π  (r −  a ) (2r +  2  ) a , where  a =  sinθ − 1. Thus, the volume function is the same

                        e)  Argue that the maximum value of r that needs to be considered occurs when the bottom of
                            the sphere is at the top of the cone (a > 0). In this case  r  =  a =  sinθ  .

                 Section 3.4 – L’Hôpital’s Rule



                 John Bernoulli discovered a rule using derivatives to calculate limits of fractions whose numerator
                 and denominators both approach zero or ±∞. The rule is known today as L’Hôpital’s Rule, after a
                 French mathematician Guillaume de L’Hôpital.









                                                           (1661  −  1704 )


                 His name is firmly associated with l'Hôpital's rule for calculating limits involving indeterminate
                 forms 0/0 and ∞/∞. Although the rule did not originate with l'Hôpital, it appeared in print for the first
                 time in his 1696 treatise on the infinitesimal calculus, entitled:
                         "Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l Intelligence des Lignes Courbes "
                                                              '
                 This book was a first systematic exposition of differential calculus. Several editions and translations
                 to other languages were published and it became a model for subsequent treatments of calculus.

                 Section 3.5 – Newton’s Method and Linear Approximation



                 3.5−1  Procedure for Newton’s Method



                 The goal of Newton’s method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, for estimating a solution
                 of an equation  ( ) 0f x =  is to produce a sequence of approximations that approach the solution.





























                 We begin with the first number  x of the sequence. Then the function is approximated by its tangent
                                                 0
                 line, and one computes the x-intercept of this tangent line.

                 At each step, the method approximates a zero of f with a zero of one of its linearization.

                                                                                                      ( ))
                    Initial estimates,  x ,  the method than uses the tangent curve  y =  f  ( ) @x  ( x  , fx   to
                                      0                                                           0     0
                    approximate the curve, calling the point  x  where the tangent meets the x-axis. The number  x
                                                             1                                                 1
                    usually a better approximation to the solution that is  x . The point  x  where the tangent to the
                                                                         0             2

                    curve at  x 1 , fx 1   crosses the x-axis is the next approximation in the sequence. We continue

                    on using each approximation to generate the next, until we are close enough to the root to stop.

                                                                       (

                 The point-slope equation for the tangent to the curve at  x n , fx n   is

                 Suppose that  y =  f  ( ) x  is continuous at every point of the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable at
                                                   f
                 every point of its interior (a, b). If  ( ) a =  f  ( ) b , then there is at least on number c in (a, b) at which
                  f ′ ( ) 0c = .



















                 Proof


                    Being continuous,  f  assumes absolute maximum and minimum values on [a, b]. These can
                    occur only
                        1.  At interior points where  f ′  is zero,

                        2.  At interior points where  f ′  does not exist,
                        3.  At the endpoints of the function’s domain, in this case a and b.


                    By hypothesis,  f has a derivative at every interior point. That rules out possibility (2), leaving us
                    with interior points where  f ′ =  and with the two endpoints a and b.
                                                   0
                    If either maximum or the minimum occurs at a point c between a and b. then  f ′ = .
                                                                                                    0
                    If both the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum occur at the endpoints, then because
                                                                                       f
                     f  ( ) a =  f  ( ) b  it must be the case that  f  is a constant function with  ( ) x =  f  ( ) a =  f  ( ) b  for
                                   ]
                                                 ′
                    every  x∈ [ , ab . Therefore  ( ) 0fx =  and the point c can be taken anywhere in the interior (a, b).

          3.5−8  The Mean Value Theorem


          Suppose  y =  f  ( ) x  is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the interval’s

          interior ( ,   ) . Then there is at least one point c in (a, b) at which

          The function  ( ) x =  x  is continuous for 0 x≤≤  and differentiable for 0 x<< . Since  ( ) 0f  =  0
          and  ( ) 2f  =  4 , the Mean Value Theorem says that at some point c in the interval, the derivative

           In this case we can identify c by solving the equation 2c = 2 to get c = 1.
          However, it is not always easy to find c algebraically, even though we know it always exists.
