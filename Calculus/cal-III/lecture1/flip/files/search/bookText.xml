          If a force F is applied to a particle moving along a path, we often need to know the magnitude of the force
          and the direction of motion.

             A projectile motion describes how an object fired at some angle from an initial position, and acted upon
             by only the force of gravity, moves in a vertical coordinate plane. We ignore the effects of any frictional
             drag on the object, which may vary with its speed and altitude, and also the fact the force of gravity
             changes slightly with the projectile’s changing height.

             To derive equations for projectile motion, we assume that the projectile behaves like a particle moving in
             a vertical coordinate plane and the only force acting on the projectile during its flight is the constant force
             of gravity, which always points straight down.

             2.  has the same curvature the curve has at P

             3.  lies toward the concave or inner side of the curve
























           The radius of curvature of the curve at P is the radius of the circle of curvature, which is

                                               Radius of  curvature ρ=  =  1

          To find ρ, we find κ and take the reciprocal. The center of curvature of the curve at P is the center of the
          circle of curvature.
