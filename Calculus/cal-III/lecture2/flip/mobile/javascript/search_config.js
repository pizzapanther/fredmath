The streams are following paths of           steepest descent so the waters reach lower elevation as quickly as possible. Therefore, the fastest           instantaneous rate of change in a stream’s elevation above the sea level has a particular direction.

Poiseuille’s law is a fundamental law of fluid dynamics that describes the flow velocity of a viscous                   incompressible fluid in a cylinder (it is used to model blood flow through veins and arteries). It says                   that in a cylinder of radius R and length L, the velocity of the fluid  r ≤  R  units from the centerline                                                2                   of the cylinder is V =  P  ( R −  r 2 ) , where P is the difference in the pressure between the ends of                                        4Lυ                   the cylinder and υ  is  the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that P and υ  are constant, the velocity V                    along the centerline of the cylinder (r =  ) 0  is V =  kR 2  , where k is a constant that we will take to be                                                                     L                   k = 1.                                   a)  Estimate the change in the centerline velocity (r =  ) 0  if the radius of the flow cylinder                                                             c                        increases from  R = 3 m c  to  R =  3.05 m  and the length increases from  L =  50 m c  to                         L =  50.5 m .                                  c                                                                169","b)  Estimate the percent change in the centerline velocity if the radius of the flow cylinder R                     decreases by 1% and the length increases by 2%.                                                                     r           65.
