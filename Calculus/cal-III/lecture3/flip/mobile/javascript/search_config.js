Knowing that the medians of a triangle intersect in a point M and that each median                       bisects the triangle, conclude that the centroid of the triangle is M.                                                                313","76.  Geographers measure the geographical center of a country (which is the centroid) and the population                center of a country (which is the center of mass computed with the population density).A                hypothetical country is shown below with the location and population of five towns.                                         Assuming no one lives outside the towns, find the geographical center of the country and the                population center of the country,            77.  A disk radius r is removed from a larger disk of radius R to from an earring. Assume the earing is a                thin plate of uniform density.                               a)  Find the center of mass of the earring in terms of r and R. (Hint: Place the origin of a coordinate                    system either at the center of the larger disk or at Q; either way, the earring is symmetric about                    the x-axis.)                 b)  Show that the ratio   R   such that the center of mass lies at the point P (on the edge of the inner                                       r                     disk) is the golden mean  1+  5  .                                               2                                                                             314","Section 3.7 – Change of variables in Multiple Integrals                  Substitution in Double Integrals               Suppose that a region G in the uv-plane is transformed one-to-one into the region R in the xy-plane by              equations of the form                                                                            )                                                     x =  g ( , ,uv )  y =  h ( ,uv                                                                    x =  g ( , uv )                                                                                                                             →                                                           y =  h ( , uv )                              Cartesian uv-plane                                        Cartesian xy - plane                R is the image of G under the transformation, and G the preimage of R.                                       ∫∫  f  ( ,x y dxdy = ∫∫  f  ( ( g u , ,v ) ( ,h u v   J ( ,u v  dudv                                                                            ))                                               )                                                                                     )                                      R                  G                Definition                                                                                                            )              The Jacobian determinant or Jacobian of the coordinate transformation  x =  g ( , ,uv )  y =  h ( ,uv  is                                                x ∂  x ∂                                         )                                    J  ( ,uv =  u ∂  v ∂                                               y ∂  y ∂                                              u ∂   v ∂                                             =  x ∂  y ∂  −  x ∂  y ∂                                                      vu                                             ∂ u v∂  ∂∂                                                                              315","Example             Find the Jacobian for the polar coordinate transformation  x =  r cos ,θ  y =  r sinθ  , write the Cartesian                   ∫∫  f  ( ,x y dxdy as a polar integral.           integral          )                     R            Solution                                                                    x =  r cosθ                                                      →                                                        y =  r sinθ                                                                                       Cartesian xy −plane                        Cartesian rθ −plane                 x = r cos , θ  y =  r sinθ   transform the rectangle G: 0 ≤ ≤ 1, 0 θ ≤  2π ≤  , into the quarter circle R                                                                    r              bounded by  x +  2  y =  2  1 in QI.                           x ∂   x ∂                     )               J ( , r θ =  r ∂  ∂  θ                          y ∂   y ∂                          r ∂  ∂  θ                          cosθ     r −  sinθ                       =                         sinθ    r cosθ                          r cos θ =  2  r sin θ +  2                          r ( cos θ =  2  sin θ +  2  )                        =  r                                                                           316","Example                           4                              2                                                                                                   y              Evaluate  ∫∫    1  y+ 1     2x y−   dxdy   by applying the transformation u =  2x −  y  , v =  2   and integrating                                        2                                                                                        2                             1                         0                             2 y              over an appropriate region in the uv-plane.
