They are represented by a vector,              in a subset of Euclidean space, at each point in their domain, producing a vector field.              Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout              space, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it              changes from point to point. A line integral can be used to find the rate at which the fluid flows along or              across a curve within the domain.                Vector Fields                Suppose a region in the plane or in space occupied by a moving fluid, such air or water. The fluid is made              up of a large number of particles, where a particle has a velocity which can vary. Such a fluid flow is an              example of a vector field.               Vectors fields are associated with forces such as gravitational attraction, and to magnetic fields, electric              fields, and also purely mathematical fields.                                                                                                            333","A vector filed is a function that assigns a vector to each point in its domain.

It is the two-dimensional special case of the more           general Stokes' theorem, and is named after British mathematician George Green.           Green’s theorem applies to any vector field, independent of any particular interpretation of the field,           provided assumptions of the theorem are satisfied, We introduce two new ideas for Green’s theorem:           divergence and circulation density around an axis perpendicular to the plane.
