                 2.1−2  Definition of the Derivative

                 The derivative of a function  f at a point  x , denoted  fx   is

                 If  f ′  exists at a particular x, we say that  f  is differentiable (has a derivative) at x.

                 If  f ′  exists at every point in the domain of  f , we call  f  differentiable

                 The process of finding derivatives is called differentiation.

                 Section 2.3 –Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions




                 In physics, the harmonic motion is associated with an object with a mass oscillating. A simple
                 harmonic motion can be determined by using sine or cosine functions.

                                        Hyperbolic Functions




                 In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function of exponential.

                 Logarithmic functions (ln x ,  can rescale large quantities.

                 Exponential functions  e    play an important role in modeling population growth, the decay of
                 radioactive materials, and most engineering problems.

          2.5−11  Relationship Between Trigonometric and Hyperbolic

                        Functions


          The trigonometric functions are based on relationships involving a circle, also known as circular
          functions. Specifically, cost  and sint  are equal to x- and y-coordinates, respectively, of the point

          P ( ,xy  on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle of t radians.





















          Observe that t is twice the area of the circular sector.

          The hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are defined in analogous fashion using the hyperbola

          x −  2  y =  2  1 instead the circle  x +  2  y =  2  1.

                       t is twice the area of hyperbolic sector

                 Section 2.6 – Implicit Differentiation




                 In most mathematics, we can express implicit equation as the value of the dependent variable directly
                 (explicitly) as a function of the independent variable. The majority of differentiation problems in
                 first-year calculus involve functions y written explicitly as functions of x. In section, we are going to
                 introduce the Implicit differentiation which is nothing more than the chain rule for derivatives.

                 Example 1

                 How fast does the area change with respect to the diameter when the diameter is 10 m?

                 Solution

                    The rate of change of the area with respect to the diameter is

                 Suppose that an object is moving along a coordinate line (an s-axis), usually horizontal or vertical, so
                 that we know its position s on that line as a function of time t:

                 The displacement of the object over the time interval from t  to t  + ∆t is

                                                       ∆ s =  ( ft +∆ −  ft

                 And the average velocity of the object over that time interval is

          Example 3

          A dynamic blast blows a heavy rock straight up with a launch velocity of 160 ft/sec (about 109 mph).

          Example 7

          A particle moves clockwise at a constant rate along a circle of radius 10 feet centered at the origin.
          The particles initial position is (0, 10) on the y-axis and its final destination is the point (10, 0) on the
          x-axis. Once the particle is in motion, the tangent line at P intersects the x-axis at a point Q (which
          moves over time). If it takes the particle 30 sec to travel from start to finish, how fast is the point Q
          moving along the x-axis when it is 20 feet from the center of the circle?

          Example 8

          A jet airliner is flying at a constant altitude of 12,000 feet above sea level as it approaches a Pacific
          island. The aircraft comes within the direct line of sight of a radar station located on the island, and
          the radar indicates the initial angle between sea level and its line of sight to the aircraft is 30°. How
          fast (in miles per hour) is the aircraft approaching the island when first detected by the radar
                                                                               2

          Solution
             From the triangle:


              tanθ =  12,000
                        x
              x =  12,000
                  tanθ

                =  12,000 cotθ  mi
                   5,280

              dx  = − 12,000 csc θ

                 =  −  12,000 csc 2 π    ⋅  2  deg π  3600 sec
                     5,280       6     3 sec  180°  1  hr

                 ≈− 380  mi  / hr

             The negative appears because the distance x is decreasing, so the aircraft is approaching the island
             at a speed of approximately 380 mi/hr when first detected by the radar.

          A rope is running through a pulley at P and bearing a weight W at one end. The other end is held 5
          feet above the ground in the hand M of a worker. Suppose the pulley is 25 feet above ground, the
          rope is 45 feet long, and the worker is walking rapidly away from the vertical line PW at the rate of 6
          ft/sec. How fast is the weight being raised when the worker’s hand is 21 feet away from PW?
