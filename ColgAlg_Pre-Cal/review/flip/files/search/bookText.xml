        Solving an Applied Problem


            1.  Read the problem carefully until you understand what is given and what is to be found
            2.  Assign a variable to represent the unknown value.

            3.  Write an equation using the variable expression(s).
            4.  Solve the equation.

            5.  State the answer to the problem. Does it seem reasonable?
            6.  Check the answer.




        Example

        According to the US Department of Education (2007 data), there is a gap between teaching salaries for men
        and women at private colleges and universities. The average salary for men exceeds the average salary for
        women by $14,037. Combined their average salaries are $130,015. Determine the average teaching salaries
        at private colleges for women and for men.
        Solution

           You are choosing between two long-distance telephone plans.
           Plan A has a monthly fee of $15 with a charge of $0.08 per minute for all long distance calls.
           Plan B has a monthly fee of $3 with a charge of $0.12 per minute for all long distance calls.
           For how many minutes of long-distance calls will the costs for the two plans be the same?

           Solution
             Plan A has a monthly fee of $15 with a charge of $0.08 per minute for all long distance calls.
                  A = 15 + .08x

             Plan B has a monthly fee of $3 with a charge of $0.12 per minute for all long distance calls.
                  B = 3 + .12x
             Costs for the two plans be the same

                     A = B
               15 + .08x = 3 + .12x
               .08x – 0.12x = 3 – 15

               – 0.04x = – 12

        The length of a rectangular basketball court is 44 feet more than the width. If the perimeter of the basketball
        court is 288 feet. What are the dimensions?
        Solution

              Length of a rectangular basketball court is 44 feet more than the width
            l = w + 44  (1)

            P = 288 = 2l + 2w               Divide by 2 both sides

            144 = l + w
            l + w =144 (2)

            From (1) → (2): w + 44 + w = 144

            2w = 100
            w =  50  ft
