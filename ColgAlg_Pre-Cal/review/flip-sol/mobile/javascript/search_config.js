Solution              Let x = the number of plants originally stolen.                        st                                                                               rd                                                  nd                      1  Guard                   2  Guard                     3  Guard                                                                                          )                                                             )                               )               y =  x −  ( 1  x +  2     y =   y −  ( 1  y +  2       y =  y −  ( 1  y +  2                1       2                  2    1    2  1              3    2    2   2                  =  x −  1  x −  2         =  y −  1  y −  2            =  y −  1  y −  2                       2                        1   2  1                    2   2   2                  =  1  x − 2               =  1  y − 2                  =  1  y − 2                    2                          2  1                        2  2             y =   1  y −  2               3   2  2                     (                 =  11  y −  2 −  )  2                   22    1                 =  1  y −−                         12                   4  1                     (                 =  11  x −  2 −  )  3                   42                  =  1  x −  1  −  3                   8    2                 =  1  x −  7                   8    2             1  x −  7  = 1             8     2             1  x = 1+  7             8        2                                                             60","1  x =  9                8     2                x  =  36                 ∴ The thief originally stole 36 plants.                                                                                                                                           61","Solution              Section R.4 – Circles              Exercise              Find the distance between  (8, 2P  )  and  (3, 5Q  )             Solution                  d =  (38−  ) +  2  (5 2−  ) 2                           2     2                  =  ( ) 5−  +  ( ) 3                    =  25 9+                   =  34               Exercise             Find the distance between  ( 4, 3P −  )  and  (2, 5Q  −  )              Solution                                  2                                       +                    d =  ( 4 2  ) + (35   ) 2                          −−                      =   36 64+                      =   100                      = 10               Exercise                                              )                                                         )            Find the distance between ( 4, 1−−  and (2, 3−             Solution                                   ( 3 1)+                  d =  (2 4)+  2  +−    2                          2                              ( 2)                    =  (6) +−     2                    =  36 4+                      =  40                     =  2 10                                                                62","Exercise                                                                 )                                      (                                               )                                                     (            Find the distance between  2 3, 6  and  −    3,5 6             Solution                                  2                                    +                  d =  ( 2 3 +  3 ) (   6 5 6−  ) 2                              2                        33                               +−                    =  ( ) (       4 6 ) 2                    =  9(3) 16(6)+                      =  123              Exercise              Find the distance between (−1, −5) and (−1, 2)             Solution                  d =   (1 (1))− − −  2  + (5 2)− −  2                        2                           ( 7)                   =  0 +−     2                   =  49                   =  7              Exercise              Find the distance between (−4, 9) and (1, −3)             Solution                             2                               (3                d =   (1 4+  ) +− −  9) 2                  =  25 144+                    =  169                  = 13                                                                          63","Exercise              Find the distance between (−2, 2) and (3, −6)             Solution                               2                d =  (3 ( 2)− −  ) +−    ) 2                                  ( 6 2−                        2                           ( 8)                   =  5 +−     2                   =  25 64+                     =  89              Exercise                                                          )                                                                         )                                                               (            Find the distance between the points  (  5,−  3  and  −  7, 7 .
