The loudness of sounds is measured in a unit called a decibel. To measure with this unit, we first               assign an intensity of  I to a very faint sound, called the threshold sound. If a particular sound has                                     0               intensity I, then the decibel rating of this louder sound is                                                        d = 10log  I                                                                 I                                                                  0               Find the exact decibel rating of a sound with intensity 10,000I                                                                           0                                                                   202","76.
