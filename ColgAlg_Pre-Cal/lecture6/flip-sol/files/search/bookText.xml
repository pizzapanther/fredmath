             Exercise

             Indicate the angle if it is an acute or obtuse. Then give the complement and the supplement of each angle.

                    a)  10°       b)  52°        c)  90°       d) 120°       e) 150°
             Solution

                a)  Acute;
                    Complement is 90°  − 10° = 80°;
                    Supplement is  180° − 10° = 170°.

                b)  Acute;
                    Complement is 90°  − 52° = 38°;
                    Supplement is  180° − 52° = 128°.

                c)  Neither (right angle);
                    Complement is 90°  − 90° = 0°;
                    Supplement is  180° − 90° = 90°.
                d)  Obtuse;
                    Complement is 90°  − 120° = −30°;

                    Supplement is  180° − 120° = 60°.
                e)  Obtuse;
                    Complement is 90°  − 150° = −60°;
                    Supplement is  180° − 150° = 30°.

          A man wondering in the desert walks 2.3 miles in the direction S 31° W. He then turns 90° and walks 3.5
          miles in the direction N 59° W. At that time, how far is he from his starting point, and what is his bearing
          from his starting point?

             A diagram that shows how Diane estimates the height of a flagpole. She can't measure the distance
             between herself and the flagpole directly because there is a fence in the way. So she stands at point A
             facing the pole and finds the angle of elevation from point A to the top of the pole to be 61.7°. Then she
             turns 90° and walks 25.0 ft to point B, where she measures the angle between her path and a line from B

             When a certain skyscraper is viewed from the top of a building 50 feet tall, the angle of elevation is 59°.
             When viewed from the street next to the shorter building, the angle of elevation is 62°.
                a)  Approximately how far apart are the two structures?

             at a constant altitude. As he approaches the parking lot of a market, he notices that the angle of depression
             from his balloon to a friend’s car in the parking lot is 35°. A minute and a half later, after flying directly
             over this friend’s car, he looks back to see his friend getting into the car and observes the angle of
             depression to be 36°. At that time, what is the distance between him and his friend?

          A pilot left Fairbanks in a light plane and flew 100 miles toward Fort in still air on a course with bearing

          drop, her course to return to Fairbanks had bearing of 225°. What was her maximum distance from
          Fairbanks?

             From the triangle ABC:

          A hill has an angle of inclination of 30°. A study completed by a state’s highway commission showed that
          the placement of a highway requires that 400 feet of the hill, measured horizontally, be removed. The
          engineers plan to leave a slope alongside the highway with an angle of inclination of 60°. Located 800
          feet up the hill measured from the base is a tree containing the nest of an endangered hawk. Will this tree
          be removed in the excavation?

          Solution
              ∠ ACB = 180°−  60° = 120°

              ∠ ABC = 180° − 120° − 30° = 30°

             That implies:  CA =  CB

             Using the law of sines:

          A Station Zulu is located 120 miles due west of Station X-ray. A ship at sea sends an SOS call that is
          received by each station. The call to Station Zulu indicates that the bearing of the ship from Zulu is
          N  40  E°  . The call to Station X-ray indicates that the bearing of the ship from X-ray is  N  30  W°  .

           a)  How far is each station from the ship?

          A highway whose primary directions are north−south, is being constructed along the west coast of
          Florida. Near Naples, a bay obstructs the straight path of the road. Since the cost of a bridge is prohibitive,
          engineers decide to go around the bay. The path that they decide on and the measurements taken as shown
          in the picture. What is the length of highway needed to go around the bay?

          Solution

          A cruise ship maintains an average speed of 15 knots in going from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Barbados,
          West Indies, a distance of 600 nautical miles. To avoid a tropical storm, the captain heads out to San Juan
          in a direction of 20° off a direct heading to Barbados. The captain maintains the 15−knots speed for 10
          hours, after which time the path to Barbados becomes clear of storms.















           a)  Through what angle should the captain turn to head directly to Barbados?
           b)  Once the turn is made, how long will it be before the ship reaches Barbados if the same 15−knot
               speed is maintained?

             a)  After 10 hrs., the ship travels 15 10 150 nautical×  =   miles

                    ≈  153.6°
                 The captain needs to turn the ship through an angle of:

                        180°−  153.6  =°  26 4. °

                   ≈  30.8  hrs

                 The total time for the trip will be about 10 30.8 +  ≈  40.   8 hrs

             In attempting to fly from Chicago to Louisville, a distance of 330 miles, a pilot inadvertently took a
             course that was 10° in error.






















              a)  If the aircraft maintains an average speed of 220 miles per hours, and if the error in direction is
                  discovered after 15 minutes, through what angle should the pilot turn to head toward Louisville?
              b)  What new average speed should the pilot maintain so that the total time of the trip is 90 minutes?

             Solution

                a)  After 15 min., the ship travels

                    15 220×  =  3,300×  1 hr
                                      60 min

                             =  55   miles

                      ≈  276 miles


                    C =  cos − 1 55 +  2  276 −  2  330 2
                                  2 55       )
                                   ( )(276
                      ≈  168°

                    The pilot needs to turn through an angle of:

                       180°−  1168   12° =  °
                b)  The total time of the trip is 90 min
                    Since the pilot found that 25 min were used (error).
                    Then, there are 90 15 75−  =  min  to complete the trip.

                    The plane must travel 276 miles in 75min×  1hr  =  1.25 hrs .
                                                              60min

                        1.25
                      ≈  220.8 mi     / hr
                    The pilot must maintain a speed of 200.8 mi/hr. to complete the trip in 90 min.

                                                              147]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[Exercise

          Your movie theater has a 25−foot−high screen located 8 feet above your eye level. If you sit too close to

          back, the image is quite small, diminishing the movie’s visual impact. If you sit x feet back from the
