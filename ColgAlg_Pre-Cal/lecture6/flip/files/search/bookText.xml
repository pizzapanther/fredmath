             Basic Terminology

             Two distinct points determine line AB.


             Line segment AB:  portion of the line between A and B.

             Ray AB:  portion of the line AB starts at A and continues through B, and past B.

             Angles in General

                An angle is formed by 2 rays with the same end point.
















                The two rays are the sides of the angle, angle θ  = AOB
                O is the common endpoint and it is called vertex of the angle.


             An angle is in a Counterclockwise (CCW) direction: positive angle.
             An angle is in a Clockwise (CW) direction: negative angle.

          An angle is said to be in standard position if its initial side is along the positive x-axis and its vertex is at
          the origin. If angle θ is in standard position and the terminal side of θ  lies in quadrant I, then we say θ
          lies in QI

                                       θ ∈ QI

          If the terminal side of an angle in standard position lies along one of the axes (x-axis or y-axis), such as
          angles with measures 90°, 180°, 270°, then that called a quadrantal angle.

          Two angles in standard position with the same terminal side are called coterminal angles.

             The bearing of a line l is the acute angle formed by the north-south line and the line l.

             The notation used to designate the bearing of a line begins with N (for north) or S (for south), followed
             by the number of degrees in the angle, and ends with E (for east) or W (for west).
