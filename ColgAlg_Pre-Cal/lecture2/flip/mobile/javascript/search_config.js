One straight cut through a thick piece of cheese produces two pieces. Two straight cuts can produce                a maximum of four pieces. Two straight cuts can produce a maximum of four pieces. Three straight                cuts can produce a maximum of eight pieces.                                  You might be inclined to think that every additional cut double numbers of pieces. However, for                four straight cuts, you get a maximum of 15 pieces. The maximum number of pieces P that can be                produced by n straight cuts is given by                                                      Pn     n +  3  5n +  6                                                      ( ) =                                                                 6                  a)  Determine number of pieces that can be produces by five straight cuts.                  b)  What is the fewest number of straight cuts that are needed to produce 64 pieces?            73.
