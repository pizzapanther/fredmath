             A binomial is a sum  ab, where a and b represent numbers. If n is a positive integer, then a general

             formula for expanding (ab+  )  is given by the binomial theorem.

                    (a b+  ) =  2  a +  2  2ab b+  2

             The expansions of (ab+  )  for n = 2, 3, 4, and 5 have the following properties:

               The power of a decreases by 1 and the power of b increases by 1. For each term, the sum of the

          Relations

          A relation is any set of ordered pairs. The set of all first components of ordered pairs is called the
          domain of the relation and the set of second components is called the range of the relation.

                                                                                         Domain
          Definition of a Function

          A function is a relation between two variables such that to

          matches each element of a first set (called domain) to an element
          of a second set (called range) in such way that no element in the
          first set is assigned to two different elements in the second set.
          The domain of the function is the set of all values of the
          independent variable for which the function is defined.                                    Range

          The range of the function is the set of all values taken on by the
          dependent variable.


          Example

          Determine whether each relation is a function and find the domain and the range.

             Example


             To prepare for a triathlon, a person swims across a river to point P and then runs along a path.




















             The person swims at 7  km/hr  and runs at 22  km/hr . For what distance x is the total time for swimming
             and running 2 hours?

             Solution

                time =  distance
                         rate

               bones. For instance, an inequality that relates the height h, in cm, of an adult female and the length f,
               in cm, of her femur is  h −  (2.47 f +  54.10 ) ≤  3.72. Use the inequalities to estimate the possible
               range of heights for an adult female whose measures 32.24 cm.


























          25.  An inequality that is used to calculate the height h of an adult male from the length r of his radius is

                                                h −  (3.32r +  85.43 ) ≤  4.57

               Where h and r are both in cm. Use this inequality to estimate the possible range of heights for an
               adult male whose radius measures 26.36 cm.
