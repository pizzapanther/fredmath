          Anne and Nancy use a metal alloy that is 17.76% copper to make jewelry. How many ounces of a 15%
          alloy must be mixed with a 19% alloy to form 100 ounces of the desired alloy?

             Emma has $20,000 to invest. As her financial planner, you recommend that she diversify into three
             investements: Treasure bills that yield 5% simple interest. Treasury bonds tht yield 7% simple interest,
             and corporate bonds that yield 10% simple interest. Emma wishes to earn $1,390 per year in income.
             Also, Emma wants her investment in Treasury bills to be $3,000 more than her investment in corporate
             bonds. How much money should Emma place in each investement?

             Exercise

             Three painters (Beth, Bill, and Edie), working together, can paint the exterior of a home in 10 hours. Bill
             and Edie together have painted similar house in 15 hours. One day, all three worked on this same kind of
             house for 4  hours, after which Edie left. Beth and Bill required 8 more hours to finish. Assuming no gain
             or loss in efficiency, how long should it take each person to complete such a job alone?
             Solution

                Let x:  Beth’s time
                    y:  Bill’s time

          A patient’s kidney stone is placed 12 units away from the source of the shock waves of a lithotripter. The
          lithotripter is based on an ellipse with a minor axis that measures 16 units. Find an equation of an ellipse
          that would satisfy this situation.

          Solution

             The patient and the emitter are 12 units apart ⇒ these represent the foci of an ellipse, so c = 6.
             The minor axis: 16 units ⇒ b = 8.

             Using a vertical major axis ⇒ a = 15.

                                                                         5
             in his roof to accommodate the pipe. If the pitch of his roof is   (a rise of 5, run of 4) what are the
                                                                         4
             dimensions of the hole?
             Solution

                The length of the major axis can be determined from the pitch
                By using Pythagorean Theorem:

                 a =  4 +  2  5 =  2  41

          The fact that the orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. The aphelion of a
          planet is its greatest distance from the Sun, and the perihelion is its shortest distance. The mean distance
          of a planet from the Sun is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit.












           a)  The mean distance of Earth from the Sun is 93 million miles. If the aphelion of Earth is 94.5 million
               miles, what is the perihelion? Write an equation for the orbit of Earth around the Sun.
           b)  The mean distance of Mars from the Sun is 142 million miles. If the perihelion of Mars is 128.5
               million miles, what is the aphelion? Write an equation for the orbit of Mars about the Sun.
           c)  The aphelion of Jupiter is 507 million miles. If the distance from the center of it elliptical orbit to the
               Sun is 23.2 million miles, what is the perihelion? What is the mean distance? Write an equation for
               the orbit of Jupiter around the Sun.
           d)  The perihelion of Pluto is 4551 million miles, and the distance from the center of its elliptical orbit
               to the Sun is 897.5 million miles. Find the aphelion of Pluto. What is the mean distance of Pluto
               from the Sun? Write an equation for the orbit of Pluto about the Sun.

          Solution
             a)  The mean distance is 93 million miles  ⇒  a =  93

                 The length of the major axis is 186 million

             The elliptical ceiling in Statuary Hall is 96 feet long and 23 feet tall.

















                a)  Using the rectangular coordinate system in the figure shown, write the standard form of the
                    equation of the elliptical ceiling.
                b)  John Quincy Adams discovered that he could overhear the conversations of opposing party leaders
                    near the left side of the chamber if he situated his desk at the focus at the right side of the chamber.
                    How far from the center of the ellipse along the major axis did Adams situate his desk?

             out a distress signal that is received by two Coast Guard stations A and B, located 200 miles apart. By

          Ernest Rutherford published a paper that he described the motion of alpha particles as they are shot at a
          piece of gold foil 0.00004 cm thick. Before conducting this experiment, Rutherford expected that the
          alpha particles would shoot through the foil just as a bullet would shoot through the foil just as a bullet
          would shoot through snow. Instead, a small fraction of the alpha particles bounced off the foil. This led to
          the conclusion that the nucleus of an atom is dense, while the remainder of the atom is sparse. Only the
          density of the nucleus could cause the alpha particles to deviate from their path. The figure shows a
          diagram from Rutherford’s paper that indicates that the deflected alpha particles follow the path of one
          branch of a hyperbola.

                 model that describes the path of the particle.

          Solution

             a)  Since the particles are deflected at a 45° angle, the asymptotes will be  y = ±    x


             b)  Since the vertex is 10 cm from the center of the hyperbola, so  a = 10

             Hyperbolas have interesting reflective properties that make them useful for lenses and mirrors. For
             example, if a ray of light strikes a convex hyperbolic mirror on a line that would (theoretically) pass
             through its rear focus, it is reflected through its rear focus, it is reflected through the front focus. This
             property and that of the parabola were used to develop the Cassegrain telescope in 1672. The focus of the
             parabolic mirror and the rear focus of the hyperbolic mirror are the same point. The rays are collected by
             the parabolic mirror, reflected toward the common focus, and thus are reflected by the hyperbolic mirror
             through the opening to its front focus, where the eyepiece is located. If the equation of the hyperbola is

             y 2  −  x 2  =  1 and the focal length (distance from the vertex to the focus) of the parabola is 6, find the
              9   16
             equation of the parabola.
             Solution

                Assume the origin lies at the center of the hyperbola. The foci of the hyperbola are located on y-axis at
                (0, c±  ) , since the hyperbola has a transverse axis that is parallel to the y-axis.

          Determine Fred’s balance after making the first payment. That is, determine  B
                                                                                     1
          Solution
              B = 1.01B −  100
               1        0
                 = 1.01 (3,000 ) 100−
                 = $2,930

             Fred’s balance is $2,930 after making the first payment.

          A pond currently has 2,000 trout in it. A fish hatchery decides to add an additional 20 trout each month. Is
          it also known that the trout population is grwoing at a rate of 3% per month. The size of the population
          after n months is given bu the recursively defined sequence

             The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines that Maple Lake has 250 tons of pollutant as a
             result of industrial waste and that 10% of the pollutant present is neuttralized by solar oxidation every
             year. The EPA imposes new pollution control laws that result in 15 tons of new pollutant entering the lake

             the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings
