By measuring the difference in signal reception times, it is determined that the ship is 160                   miles closer to B than to A. Where is the ship?                                20.

Suppose that two people standing 1 mile apart both see a flash of lightning. After a period of time,                the person standing at point A hears the thunder. One second later, the person standing at point B                hears the thunder. If the person at B is due west of the person at A and the lightning strike is known                to occur due north of the person standing at point A, where did the lightning strike occur? (Sound                travels at 1100  ft / sec and 1 mile = 5280 ft  )            22.  Ernest Rutherford published a paper that he described the motion of alpha particles as they are shot                at a piece of gold foil 0.00004 cm thick. Before conducting this experiment, Rutherford expected                that the alpha particles would shoot through the foil just as a bullet would shoot through the foil just                as a bullet would shoot through snow. Instead, a small fraction of the alpha particles bounced off the                foil. This led to the conclusion that the nucleus of an atom is dense, while the remainder of the atom                is sparse. Only the density of the nucleus could cause the alpha particles to deviate from their path.                The figure shows a diagram from Rutherford’s paper that indicates that the deflected alpha particles                follow the path of one branch of a hyperbola.                                 a)  Find an equation of the asymptotes under this scenario.              b)  If the vertex of the path of the alpha particles is 10 cm from the center of the hyperbola, find a                  model that describes the path of the particle.            23.  Hyperbolas have interesting reflective properties that make them useful for lenses and mirrors. For                example, if a ray of light strikes a convex hyperbolic mirror on a line that would (theoretically) pass                through its rear focus, it is reflected through its rear focus, it is reflected through the front focus.                This property and that of the parabola were used to develop the Cassegrain telescope in 1672. The                focus of the parabolic mirror and the rear focus of the hyperbolic mirror are the same point. The rays                are collected by the parabolic mirror, reflected toward the common focus, and thus are reflected by                the hyperbolic mirror through the opening to its front focus, where the eyepiece is located.

Because c > a, it follows that e > 1 .                Describe the general shape of a hyperbola whose eccentricity is close to 1. What is the shape if e is                very large?                                                                308","25.  An explosive is recorded by two microphone that are 1 mile apart.

A pile of n rings, each smaller than the one below it, is on a peg on board. Two other pegs are                   attached to the board. In the game called the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, all the rings must moved  one                   at a time, to a different peg with no ring ever placed on top of a smaller ring. Find the least number                   of moves that would be required.
