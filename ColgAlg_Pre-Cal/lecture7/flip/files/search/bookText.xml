             Section 7.1 – Graphing Sine & Cosine



             We consider graphs of the equation:  y =  A sin (Bx C+  ) D y+  =  A cos (Bx C+  ) D+


             Amplitude


             If the greatest value of y is M and the least value of y is m, then the amplitude of the graph of y is defined
             to be


                                          A =  1  M − m
                                               2
             The amplitude is |A|.
             Note:  If A > 0, then the graph of  y =  A sin x  and  y =  A cos x  will have amplitude A and range [−A, A].



             Period

                → Period =   2π

             Many things in daily life repeat with a predictable pattern, such as weather, tides, and hours of daylight.












             This periodic graph represents a normal heartbeat.

             In the function  y =  ( f x c−  ) , the expression x – c is called the argument.

             Vertical Asymptote


             A vertical asymptote is a vertical line that the graph approaches but does not intersect, while function
             values increase or decrease without bound as x-values get closer and closer to the line.

          14.  A rotating beacon is located at point A next to a long wall. The beacon is 9 m from the wall. The
               distance a is given by a =  9 sec2 t π , where t is time measured in seconds since the beacon started

               rotating. (When t = 0, the beacon is aimed at point R.) Find a for t = 0.45
















          15.  The shortest path for the sun’s rays through Earth’s atmosphere occurs when the sun is directly
               overhead. Disregarding the curvature of Earth, as the sun moves lower on the horizon, the distance
               that sunlight passes through the atmosphere increases by a factor of cscθ , where θ is the angle of
               elevation of the sun. This increased distance reduces both the intensity of the sun and the amount of
               ultraviolet light that reached Earth’s surface.

                  from the street where your friend will be passing from left to right. If d represents your distance, in
                  feet, from your friend and x is the radian measure of the angle.
