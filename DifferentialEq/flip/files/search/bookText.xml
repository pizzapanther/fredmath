          In many applications of integrations, we are given enough information to determine a particular solution.
          To do this, we need to know the value of F(x) for one value of x. This information is called an initial

               Section 1.1 – Differential Equations & Solutions



               In the mathematical, engineering and sciences models are developed to assist in the understanding of
               physical phenomena. These models often yield an equation that contains some derivatives of an unknown
               function. Such  an equation is called  a  differential equation.  We  introduce  few major  methods
               geometrical, analytical and numerical for getting the solutions of these problems.

                                                                              ′′

               Differential equations all about solving equations involving  y , y , y ( ) 3  ,  .


               1.1-1  Ordinary Differential Equations

               Ordinary differential equations involve an unknown function of a single variable with one or more of
               its derivatives.

                              dy  =  yt
                                     −
                               dt

                       y:  ()y t is unknown function
                       t:  independent variable

               Some other examples:

                             2
                                t
                       y′ =  y −
                       ty′ =
                            y
                       y′ +  4y =  e − 3t
                       yy′′ +  t y =  2  cost

                       y′ =  cos( )

               ∴ The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation.

               1.2-3  Newton's Law of Cooling


               Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of change of an object's temperature (T) is proportional to
               the difference between its temperature  and the  ambient  temperature (A)  (i.e. the temperature of  its
               surroundings).
                                      dT  =  −  ( kT −  ) A
                                      dt


               Example 3

               A can of beer at 40° F is placed into a room when the temperature is 70° F. After 10 minutes the
               temperature of the beer is 50° F. What is the temperature of the beer as a function of time? What is the
               temperature of the beer 30 minutes after the beer was placed into the room?

               Solution

                 By Newton's Law of cooling: The rate of change of an object's temperature (T) is proportional to the
                 difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature (A).

          In mathematics, the rate at which a quantity changes is the derivative of that quantity.
               nd
          The 2  way of computing the rate of change comes from the application itself and is different from on

          1.3-1  Law of mechanics – Newton’s Second Law (1665-1671)

          The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the
          net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

          The force acting on a mass is equal to the rate of change of momentum with respect to time. Momentum
          is defined as the product of mass and velocity (m.v).

          The force is equal to the derivative of the momentum

               1.3-3  Air Resistance

               The application of force on an object causes an acceleration of that object. A force is not the only
               factor in the movement, or acceleration of an object. Air resistance involves movement through
               the air.  Air resistance is a significant factor in how fast an object falls, according to this law.

          Suppose you drop a brick from the top of a building that is 250 m high. The brick has a mass of 2 kg,
          and the resistance force is given by  R = − 4v . How long will it take the brick to reach the ground? what
          will be its velocity at that time?

               1.3-5  Torricelli’s Law

               Suppose that a water tank has a hole with area a at its bottom, from which water is leaking.




















                                                                              V
               Denote by  ( )  the depth of water in the tank at time t, and by  ( ) t  the volume of water in the tank
                           yt
               then. It is plausible – and true, under ideal conditions – that the velocity of water exiting through the hole
               is

                              v =  2gy

               Which is the velocity a drop of water would acquire in falling freely from the surface of the water to the
               hole. One can derive this formula beginning with the assumption that the sum of the kinetic and potential
               energy of the system remains constant. Under real conditions, taking into account the construction of a

               water jet from an orifice,  v =  c  2gy , where c is an empirical constant between 0 and 1 (usually about
               0.6 for a small continuous stream of water). For simplicity, we take c = 1 in the following discussion.

                                                       dV  =  −  av =  −  a  2gy
                                                        dt

                                                dV  =  −  k y    where k =   a  2g
                                                dt
               This is a statement of Torricelli’s Law for a draining tank.

                    A
               Let  ( ) y  denote the horizontal cross-sectional area of the tank at height y. Then, applied to a thin
                                                             A
               horizontal slice of water at height  y  with area  ( ) y  and thickness  dy , the integral method of cross

               sections gives


                       V  ( ) y = ∫ 0 y  A ( ) y dy




               The fundamental theorem of calculus therefore implies that   dV  =  A ( ) y   and hence that
                                                                          dy

                       dV  =  dV  ⋅  dy

          20.  One of the famous problems in the history of mathematics is the brachistochrone problem: to find
               the curve along which a particle will slide without friction in the minimum time from one given
               point P to another point Q, the second point being lower than the first but not directly beneath it.
               This problem was posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696 as a challenge problem to the mathematicians
               of his day. Correct solutions were found by Johann Bernoulli and his brother Jakob Bernoulli and
               by Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, and the Marquis de L’Hospital. The brachistochrone problem
               is important in the  development  of mathematics as one of the forerunners of the calculus of
               variations.
               In solving this problem, it is convenient to take the origin as the upper point P and to orient the
                                                                 (

               21.  Many chemical reactions are the result of the interaction of 2 molecules that undergo a change to
                     produce a new product. The rate of the reaction typically depends on the concentrations of the two
                     kinds of molecules. If a is the amount of substance A and b is the substance B at time t = 0, and if
                     x is the amount of product at time t, then the rate of formation of x may be given by the differential

          Notes

           1.  Integrating an expression that is not the differential of any  elementary  function is called non-
               elementary.

               A typical mixing problem investigates the behavior of a mixed solution of some substance. Typically,
               the solution is being mixed in a tank. A solution of a given concentration enters the mixture at some
               fixed rate and is thoroughly mixed in the tank. The tank is also being drained at some fixed rate.
               The physical representation of the rate of change:


                              dx  = rate of change
                               dt
                                 = rate in − rate out

               This is referred to as a balance law.

               The rate in and out is given by:
               Rate = Volume Rate (gal/min) x Concentration (lb./gal)

               The tank initially holds 100 gal of pure water. At time t = , a solution containing 2 lb. of salt per gallon
               begins to enter the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute. At the same time a drain is opened at the
               bottom of the tank so that the volume of solution in the tank remains constant.
               How much salt is in the tank after 60 min?

               Example 2

               The 600-gal tank is filled with 300 gal of pure water. A spigot is opened above the tank and a salt
               solution containing 1.5 lb. of salt per gallon of solution begins flowing into the tank at the rate of 3
               gal/min. simultaneously, a drain is opened at the bottom of the tank allowing the solution to leave tank
               at a rate of 1 gal/min. What will be the salt content in the tank at the precise moment that the volume of
               solution in the tank is equal to the tank's capacity (600 gal)?

               Exercises           Section 1.5 – Mixing Problems



               1.    Consider two tanks, label tank A and tank B for reference. Tank A contains 100 gal of solution in
                     which is dissolved 20 lb. of salt. Tank B contains 200 gal of solution which is dissolved 40 lbs. of
                     salt. Pure water flows into the tank A at rate of 5 gal/s. There is a drain at the bottom of tank A.
                     The solution leaves tank A via the drain at a rate of 5 gal/s and flows immediately into tank B at
                     the same rate. A drain at the bottom of tank B allows the solution to leave tank B at a rate of 2.5
                     gal/s. What is the salt content in tank B at the precise moment that tank B contains 250 gal of
                     solution?

               2.    A tank contains 100 gal of pure water. At time zero, a sugar-water solution containing 0.2 lb. of
                     sugar per gal enters the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min. Simultaneously, a drain is opened at the bottom
                     of the tank allowing the sugar solution to leave the tank at 3 gal/min. Assume that the solution in
                     the tank is kept perfectly mixed at all times.
                       a)  What will be the sugar content in the tank after 20 minutes?
                       b)  How long will it take the sugar content in the tank to reach 15 lbs.?
                       c)  What will be the eventual sugar content in the tank?

               3.    A tank initially contains 50 gal of sugar water having a concentration of 2 lb. of sugar for each gal
                     of water. At time zero, pure water begins pouring into the tank at a rate of 2 gal per minute.
                     Simultaneously, a drain is opened at the bottom of the tank so that the volume of sugar-water
                     solution in the tank remains constant.
                       a)  How much sugar is in the tank after 10 minutes?
                       b)  How long will it take the sugar content in the tank to dip below 20 lbs.?
                       c)  What will be the eventual sugar content in the tank?

               4.    A 50-gal tank initially contains 20 gal of pure water. Salt-water solution containing 0.5 lb. of salt
                     for each gallon of water begins entering the tank at a rate of 4 gal/min. simultaneously; a drain is
                     opened at the bottom of the tank, allowing the salt-water solution to leave the tank at a rate of 2
                     gal/min. What is the salt content (lb.) in the tank at the precise moment that the tank is full of salt-
                     water solution?

               5.    A tank contains 500 gal of a salt-water solution containing 0.05 lb. of salt per gallon of water.  Pure
                     water is poured into the tank and a drain at the bottom of the tank is adjusted so as to keep the
                     volume of solution in the tank constant. At what rate (gal/min) should the water be poured into the
                     tank to lower the salt concentration to 0.01 lb./gal of water in less than one hour?

               6.    Suppose that a large tank initially holds 300 gallons of water in which 50 pounds of salt have been
                     dissolved. Pure water is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min, and when the solution is well
                     stirred, it is then pumped out at the same rate. Determine a differential equation for the amount of
                                                    0

          7.   Suppose that a large mixing tank initially holds 300 gallons of water is which 50 pounds of salt
               have been dissolved. Another brine solution is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min, and
               when the solution  is well stirred, it is then pumped out at a slower rate if 2  gal/min.  If the
               concentration of the solution entering is 2 lb./gal, determine a differential equation for the amount

          8.   Suppose that a large mixing tank initially holds 300 gallons of water is which 50 pounds of salt
               have been dissolved. Another brine solution is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min, and
               when the solution is well stirred, it is then pumped out at a faster rate  if 3.5  gal/min.  If the

          9.   A tank contains 100 gal of fresh water. A solution containing 1 lb./gal of soluble lawn fertilizer
               runs into the tank at the rate of 1 gal/min, and the mixture is pumped out of the tank at a rate of 3
               gal/min. Find the maximum amount of fertilizer in the tank and the time required to reach the
               maximum.

          10.  A 200-gal tank is half full of distilled water. At time t = 0, a solution containing 0.5 lb./gal of
               concentrate enters the tank at the rate of 5 gal/min, and the well-stirred mixture is withdrawn at the
               rate of 3 gal/min.
                 a)  At what time will the tank be full?
                 b)  At the time the tank is full, how many pounds of concentrate will it contain?

          11.  A 1500-gallon tank initially contains 600 gallons of water with 5 lbs. of salt dissolved in it. Water
               enters the tank at a rate of 9 gal/hr. and the water entering the tank at a rate has a salt concentration
                  1
               of  (1 cost+  )  lbs./gal. If a well-mixed solution leaves the tank at a rate of  6 gal/hr., how much
                  5
               salt is in the tank when it overflows?

               The form of a homogeneous equation suggests that it may be simplified by using a variable denoted by
                v
                '', to represent the ratio of y to x. This
                                    dy
                       y =  xv ⇒       =  F ( ) v
                                    dx
               Let assume that v is a function of x, then

                       dy   x dv           F      x dv  v
                       dx  =  dx  +  v ⇒     ( ) v =  dx  +
               The most significant fact about this equation is  that the variables  x  &  v  can always be separated,
               regardless of the form of the function F.

                              dx  =   dv

               Solving this equation and then replacing v by    gives the solution of the original equation.

          1.7-1  Modeling Population Growth

          The mathematical model of the growth of a population is given by:

                                                        P′ =  rP

          Where r: reproductive rate.

          The natural of the predictions of the model depend on the nature of the reproductive rate r.


          1.7-2  Malthusian Method

          Since r is a constant because the birth or death rates do not depend on time or on the size.
              dP  =  rP
              dt
              ∫∫        rdt

          Therefore, the solution to  P′ =  rP   is given by:

          1.7-3  Logistic Model of Growth

          Logistic population growth occurs when the growth rate decreases as the population reaches carrying
          capacity. Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals in a population that the
          environment can support.
          Suppose an environment is capable of sustaining no more than a fixed number K of individuals in its
          populations. The quantity K is called the carrying capacity of the environment. In reality this model in
          unrealistic because environments impose limitations to population growth.

          The logistic equation is given by:

                                                                                    r

          The logistic equation can be solved by separation of variables
                 dP  =  rP ( 1−  P )
                  dt          K

          Exercises         Section 1.7 - Modeling Population Growth



          1.   The rate of growth of bacteria in a petri dish is proportional to the number of bacteria in the dish.


          2.   The rate of growth of a population of field mice is inversely proportional to the square root of the
               population.

          3.   A biologist starts with 100 cells in a culture. After 24 hrs., he counts 300. Assuming a Malthusian
               model, what the reproductive rate? What will be the number of cells of the end of 5 days?

          4.   A biologist prepares a culture. After 1 day of growth, the biologist counts 1000 cells. After 2days,
               he counts 3000. Assuming a Malthusian model, what the reproductive rate and how many cells
               were present initially?

          5.   A population of bacteria is growing according to the Malthusian model. If the population is triples
               in 10 hrs., what is the reproduction rate? How often does the population double itself?

          6.   Consider a lake that is stocked with walleye pike and that the population of pike is governed by the
               logistic equation
                                         (
                                             P
                                       P
                                P′ =  0.1 1−  10 )
               Where time is measured in days and P in thousands of fish. Suppose that fishing is started in this
               lake and that 100 fish are removed each day.
               a)  Modify the logistic model to account for the fishing.
               b)  Find and classify the equilibrium points for your model.
               c)  Use qualitative analysis to completely discuss the fate of the fish population with this model.
                   In particular, if the initial fish population is 1000, what happens to the fish as time passes?
                   What will happen to an initial population having 2000 fish?

          7.   Suppose that in 1885 the population of a certain country was 50 million and was growing at the
               rate of 750,000 people per year at that time. Suppose also that in 1940 its population was 100
               million and was then growing at the rate of 1 million per year. Assume that this population satisfies
               the logistic equation. Determine both the limiting population M and the predicted population for
               the year 2000.


          8.   The time rate of change of a rabbit population P is proportional to the square root of P. At time
               t =  0  (months) the population numbers 100 rabbits and is increasing at the rate of 20 rabbits per
               month. How many rabbits will there be one year later?

                                                P
                                                                                                  0
          9.   Suppose that the fish population  ( ) t  in a lake is attacked by a disease at time  t = , with the
                                                                               0
               result that the fish cease to reproduce (so that the birth rate is  β = ) and the death rate δ (deaths
               per week per fish) is thereafter proportional to   1  . If there were initially 900 fish in the lake and
                                                              P
               441 were left after 6 weeks, how long did it take all the fish in the lake to die?]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[1.7 - M ode l i ng  P opul a t i o n G r ow t h  | 107


               10.  Suppose that when a certain lake is stocked with fish, the birth and death rates β and δ are both
                     inversely proportional to  P
                                            ( 1        ) 2

                       b)  If  P = 100 and after 6 months there are 169 fish in the lake, how many will there be after 1
                              0
                          year?

               11.  The time rate of change of an alligator population P in a swamp is proportional to the square of P.
                     The swamp contained a dozen alligators in 1988, two dozen in 1998.
                       a)  When will there be four dozen alligators in the swamp?
                       b)  What happens thereafter?

               12.  Consider a prolific breed of rabbits whose birth and death rates, β and δ, are each proportional to
                     the rabbit population  P =  P ( ) t , with  β  δ >
                                              P
                       a)  Show that  ( ) t =   0   , k constant

               An electric circuit is a path in which electrons from a voltage or current source flow. The point where

               1.8-1  Resistor: (Ohm’s Law)

               A resistor is a component of a circuit that resists the flow of electrical current. It has two terminals across
               which electricity must pass, and it is designed to drop the voltage of the current as it flows from one
               terminal to the other. Resistors are primarily used to create and maintain known safe currents within
               electrical components.

               A voltage  ()Vt  across the terminals of a resistor is proportional to the current  ()It  in it. The constant

          1.8-2  Inductor: (Faraday’s Law)

          When a current in a circuit is changing, then the magnetic flux is linking the same circuit changes. This
          change in flux causes an emf v to be induced in the circuit.


          Inductance is symbolized by letter L, is measured in henrys (H), and is represented graphically as a
          coiled wire – a reminder that inductance is a consequence of a conductor linking a magnetic field.






                      V
          The voltage  ( ) t  is proportional to the time rate of change of the current, and is given by:

                        V =   L  dI

               1.8-3  Capacitance: (Coulomb’s Law)
               The circuit parameter of  capacitance  is represented by letter C, is measured in  farads  (F), and  is

               symbolized graphically by two short parallel conductive plates.





               The farad is an extremely large quantity of capacitance, practical capacitor values usually lie in the
               picofarad (pF) to microfarad (µF) range.

               The graphic symbol for a capacitor is a reminder that capacitance occurs whenever electrical conductors
               are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material. This condition implies that electric charge is not
               transported through the capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the terminals of the capacitor cannot
               move a charge through the dielectric, it can displace a charge within the dielectric. As the voltage varies
               with time, the displacement of charge also varies with time, causing what is known as the displacement
               current.

               The potential v between the terminals of a capacitor is proportional to the charge q on it.

          1.8-7  Example

          The electrical analog of a carriage on wheels, coupled to the wall through a spring.











                               a) Mechanical system.               b) Electrical analog.

                                A mechanical system with a one coordinates movement.
           In the case of the electrical network, the equation was obtained by applying Kirchhoff's current law at

          the node v, and is seen to be identical to the equation that would have  been obtained by applying
          D'Alembert's principle to the mechanical system.
          The differential equation for both systems is:

                             2
                        M  d x  +  D  dx  +  kx =  f  ( ) t
                            dt 2    dt
          In particular, if one uses the force current analogy (or force-torque for a rational system). The topology
          of the electrical analog is very similar to that of the mechanical system.

                 Existence: Under what conditions does the Initial Value Problem (IVP) have at least one solution?

                 Uniqueness: Under what conditions does the IVP have at most one solution?
                 Extension and Long-Term Behavior: How far ahead into the future and back into the past does a
                   solution extend? How does a solution behave as t gets large?

                 Continuity: Suppose the data f and  y  change. Can the corresponding change in solution be limited

             2.1-1  Newton's - Hooke’s Law for Springs: F = kx


             Hooke’s Law is a principle of physics that states that the force (F) needed to stretch or compress a spring x
             units from its natural (unstressed) length is proportional to x. In symbols, that is

                                    F =  kx


             The constant k, measured in force units per unit length, is a characteristic of the spring, called the force
             constant (or spring constant) of the spring.

             The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke.

             2.1-5  Wronskian

             The Wronskian is a determinant introduced and named after the Polish mathematician Józef Hoene-Wroński
             (1776) and it is used to determine whether a set of differentiable functions (solutions) is linearly independent
             on a given interval.

             2.3-3  Damped, Free Vibrations

             Simple Harmonic Motion with a Damping Force can be used to describe the motion of a mass at the end of
             a spring under the influence of friction.

             When a damped oscillator is subject to a damping force which is linearly dependent upon the velocity, such
             as viscous damping, the oscillation will have exponential decay terms which depend upon a damping
             coefficient.

        In the special case when there is no damping (c =  ) 0  the motion is called simple harmonic motion.

                x′′ + ω 2 x =  0
                      0

        The characteristic equation is:   λ  2  ω +  2  =  0
                                                0
        The roots are λ  2   ω = −  2  λ →  i ±  ω =
                               0           0
         xt    a cos ω  t b sin ω  t
          ( ) =
                        +
                     0          0
                                                     π =
            If we define period: T =  2π      T ω⇒  2
                                    ω           0
                                      0
            Then the periodic of the trigonometry functions implies that  ( x t T+  ) =  xt
                                                                                  ()  for all t.
            Thus, the solution x is periodic with period T.

            ω is called the natural frequency.

             2.3-8  Pendulum

             A simple Pendulum consists of a mass m swinging back and forth on the end if a string of length L.























             We specify the position of the mass at time t by giving the counterclockwise angle θ  θ =  ( ) t  that the string
             or rod makes with the vertical at time t. To analyze the motion of the mass m, we apply the law of the
             conservation of mechanical energy, according to which the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy

             The distance along the circular arc from 0 to m is  s =  Lθ , so the velocity of the mass is

          Check the homogeneous solution first, then start with next power for the particular solution.

               If we use the same power, we can add the constants which result with another constant. Therefore,
               we do not need to use the same power or the same terms as the homogeneous solution.

        In this section, we will add to the homogeneous equation of motion that we covered, an external force. This
        force, will be in general time-dependent, and it would lead to non-homogeneous equations of motion.

        A sinusoidal forcing is giving by the model:

                                               ω

             2.6-6  Transient and Steady-State

             A motion or current is transient solution if the solution approaches zero as t → ∞ .
             A steady-state motion or current is one that is not transient and does not become unbounded.
             Free damped systems always yield transient motions, while forced damped systems (assuming the external
             force to be sinusoidal) yield both transient and steady-state motions.

             2.7-1  Euler's method named after Leonhard Euler is an example of a fixed-step solver.
             Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with
             a given  initial value.  It  is the most basic kind of  explicit method  for  numerical integration of ordinary
             differential equations. The Euler method often serves as the basis to construct more complex methods.

             2.7-2  Runge-Kutta Methods

             Like Euler's method, the Runge-Kutta methods are fixed-step solvers.

             2.7-3  The Second-Order Runge-Kutta Method

             The Second-Order Runge-Kutta method is also known as the improved Euler's method.
             It is generally referred to as “RK2”

                                               (
             Starting from the initial value point  x 0   , y 0 )  , we compute two slopes:
                           (
                    s =  ft    , y  )
                     1      0    0

                    s =   f t +  (  h  , y +  hs  )
                     2       0       0    1
                                s +  s
                    y =  y +  h  1   2
                     1    0        2
             But an analysis using Taylor's theorem reveals that there is an improvement in the estimate for the truncation
             error.
             For the Second-Order Runge-Kutta method, we have

                                    3
                     y () −  t 1  y ≤  1  Mh


             The constant M depends on the function  (, )f ty .
             The Second-Order Runge-Kutta method is controlled by the cube of the step size instead of the square.

             2.7-4  Fourth-Order  Runge-Kutta Method

             This method is the most commonly used solution algorithm. For most equations and systems, it is suitably
             fast, simple and accurate. It is generally referred to as “RK4”.
             It is the best for numerical solution of differential equations when combined with an intelligent adaptive
             step-size routine.

               Section 3.1 − Definition of the Laplace Transform



               3.1-1  Definition

               In mathematics, the Laplace  Transform is an integral transform named after its discoverer Pierre-
               Simon Laplace. Laplace transforms are restricted to functions of t and transform a function of a complex
               variable s. The Laplace operator will transform a linear differential equation with constant coefficients
               into an algebraic equation in the transformed function.

               Suppose  ()ft  is a function of t defined for t > .
               Then, the Laplace transform of  f  is given by the formula:


                                     £  { }( )  =  F ( ) s = ∫  ∞  f  ( ) t e − st dt
                                         f s
                                                             0

               The integral of the Laplace transform is an improper integral because the
               upper limit is ∞.                                                           Pierre Simon Laplace
                                                                                              (1749 – 1827)

               The domain of F is the set of real number s for which the improper integral converges.

          3.2-1  The Laplace Transform of Derivatives

          To find the Laplace Transform of a derivative, integrate the expression for the definition of the Laplace
          Transform by parts. Some useful properties that will help us derive Laplace Transform. These properties,
          will let us use Laplace Transform to solve differential equations and even to do higher order systems
          with initial conditions.

               3.4-4  Electrical Circuit


               Similar to the application of phasor transform to solve the steady state AC circuits, Laplace transform
               can be used to transform the time domain circuits into s−domain circuits to simplify the solution of
               integral differential equations to the manipulation of a set of algebraic equations.
               The elegance of using the Laplace transform in circuit analysis lies in the automatic inclusion of the
               initial conditions in the transformation process, thus providing a complete (transient and steady state)
               solution.

          3.4-7  Circuit Element Models

          The method used as follow:
           1.  Write the differential equation model.

           2.  Use Laplace transform to convert the model to s−domain.
           3.  Solve the ODE in s−domain.
           4.  Convert to t−time domain using the inverse Laplace transform.


          Another approach, more direct approach is as follow:

           1.  Develop s−domain models for the circuit elements.
           2.  Draw the Laplace equivalent circuit keeping the interconnections and replacing the elements by
               their s−domain models.
           3.  Analyze the Laplace equivalent circuit.
           4.  Convert to t−time domain using the inverse Laplace transform.

             If both masses move the same amount in the same direction, then the middle spring will not have
             changed length and it will result  x −  x =  0.

               A system of differential equations is a set of one or more equations, involving one or more differential
               equations.

               There are several physical problems that involve number of separate elements such as an example:
               electrical networks, mechanical, and more other fields.



               3.5-1  Example of Predator-Prey Systems (Ecology)

               The dynamical of biological growth of populations is a branch of ecology.

               The growth rate of species is depending on their population. The rate is increased by birth and food
               supply causes the species to live, and decreased by death, overcrowded, etc.….

               Consider two species that exist together and interact as an example such as wolves and deer, shark and
               food fish, etc... Vito Volterra, an Italian mathematician, formulated a predator-prey system model.

                   Let the prey population denoted by () .
                                                     Ft
                                                         Gt
                   Let the predator population denoted by () .

                         Ft
               For each  () and  ()Gt , we have a reproductive rate which denoted by r  and r for prey and predator
                                                                                     F       G
               respectively.
               Therefore, that will imply to:

                             G
               Let assume there is absence of predator, by using Malthusian model, the prey population will be given
               by
                       G =  0   ⇒  R   =  a >  0
                                    F

               When there are predator activities,  then,  and the decrease in the reproductive rate  would also be
               proportional to  ()Gt .

                       R   =  a bG      , a  b >  0
                         F
               In the absence of prey, by using Malthusian model, the predator population will be given by

                       F =  0

                       →   R   = −<   0

          The presence of the prey would decrease in the reproductive rate would be proportional to the size of the
          prey population.

          This model is nonlinear because the right-side contains the product  FG .
          It is autonomous because the right-side doesn’t depend explicitly on the independent variable.



          3.5-2  Summary of Predator-Prey

          The Predator-Prey or Lotka–Volterra system is given by:

                   x =   −  ax bxy
                          +

                         −
                  y = cy dxy
          Where x is the predator, their prey is ‘y’, and the coefficient a, b, c, and d are positive real numbers and
          they are defined as follow:

                 a: is the natural decay.
                 ax: is a rate term, which shows that without prey to eat, the predator population diminishes.

                 c: is the natural growth coefficient.
                 cy: is a rate term, where the prey population increases.
                 b and c: predator efficiency in converting food into fertility and the probability that are predator-prey
                            encounter removes of the prey.

                 bxy and cxy: Food promotes the predator population’s growth rate, while serving as food diminishes the
                               prey populations’ growth rate.

          The predator-prey system or model is based on the population Law of Mass Action.
          The Law of Mass Action is defined as:

                 “The rate of change of one population due to interaction of another is proportional to the
                 product of the two populations.”]]></page><page Index="286"><![CDATA[3.5 - I nt r oduc t i on  &  B a s i c   T h e or y  of  L i n e a r  S y s t e m s  | 271

               Let V be the voltage drop across the capacitor and I current through the inductor.

               The current is described by the equation:   dI  =  V
                                                           dt   L

               The voltage is described by the equation:   dV  =  −  1  −  V

               Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as system equations

               The values of  λ   are called eigenvalues  of the matrix A  and the nonzero vectors  v   are called the

               Where A is a square matrix (n x n)

               The behavior of a system can be determined from equilibrium point(s) by finding the eigenvalues and
               the eigenvectors of the system.
               Therefore; the equation can be rewritten into the form:

               3.6-5  Summary

               In general, a polynomial of degree n has n roots. Each root λ  is an eigenvalue, and for each we can find

               an eigenvectorv . From these, we can form the solution ()y t =  ve  t λ .
               However, the numbers of the eigenvalue solutions are as follow:
                                           (  2         )
                 1.  Two Distinct real roots T −  4D >  0
                                                  (  2         )
                 2.  Two complex conjugate roots T −    4D <  0

                                            (  2         )
                 3.  One real Repeated root  T −  4D =  0

               Suppose  λ  and  λ  are eigenvalues of an  nn×   matrix A. Suppose V ≠  is an eigenvector for  λ

               and V ≠  is an eigenvector for λ . If λ      λ ≠   then V  and V  are linearly independent.

          3.6-7  Distinct Real Eigenvalues



          If T −  2  4D >  0 , then the solutions of the characteristic equation are:


                             T −   T −  2  4D               T +  T −  2  4D

          Then λ    λ <  , and both are real eigenvalues of A.

          Let V  and V  be the associated eigenvectors. Then we have two exponential solutions:
               1       2

                 y  () t = V e λ  1 t  and  y  () t = V e λ  2 t

          Example 3
          Two tanks are connected by two pipes. Each tank contains 500 gallons of a salt solution. Through on
          pipe solution is pumped from the first tank to the second at 1 gal/min. Through the other pipe, solution
          is pumped at the same rate from the second to the first tank. Suppose that at time  t =  there is no salt
                                                                                             0
          in the tank on the right and 100 lb. in the tank on the left. Show the salt content in each tank varies with
          time.

               9 L/min. Finally, there is a drain on tank B from which salt solution drains at a rate of 5 L/min.
               Thus, each tank maintains a constant volume of 360 liters of salt solution. Initially, there are 60 kg
               of salt present in tank A, but tank B contains pure water.

          3.7-1  Equilibrium Points
          The dynamical behavior of a linear system is easier than non-linear system. We need to determine a set

          of points to satisfy the autonomous system y′ = ( y′ =  f  ( ( ), ) ≡  ) 0 . These set of points are called
          equilibrium points.

          From these equilibrium points, we can determine the stability of the system.


          The equilibrium pointO  is the intersection of the eigenvectors, and we can plot those two lines by
                                 1
          joining these points V O  and VO  together.

          The convergence of the series     c n  (xa−  )  is described by one of the following three cases:



           1.  There is a positive number  R  such the series  diverges for  x  with  xa−  >  R   but converges

               absolutely for x with  xa−  <  R . The series may or may not converge at either of the endpoints

                                   +

           2.  The series converges absolutely for every x (R = ∞ .
           3.  The series converges at x = a and diverges elsewhere (R = 0)


          R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the interval of radius R centered at x = a

          is called the interval of convergence.

               4.1-6  How to Test a Power Series for Convergence

                 1.  Use the Ratio Test (or Root Test) to find the interval where the series converges. Ordinarily, this
                     is an open interval
                                                                     −
                                                                           x
                                                                                 +
                                                    xa <   R   or a R < <      a R
                                                     −

               4.5-2  Gamma Function


               Many important functions in applied sciences are defined via improper integrals. Maybe the most
               famous among them is the Gamma Function.

               The series solution is denoted by  J  ( ) x :
                                                 υ

                       J   ( ) x =      ! n Γ (1− υ+  n ) 2

          applications, but also from the fact that the solutions of many other second-order linear differential
          equations can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions.

             There are two types of circuits – direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) circuits.

             DC − circuits are the circuits where the voltage (current) is constant in time. Capacitor is an open circuit,

                  like it’s not there
             Transient: A circuit changes from one DC configuration to another DC configuration (a source value
                       changes or a switch flips).
                       Determine the DC state (current, voltages, etc.) before the change.

                       Then determine what happens after the change. Over time, the circuit will settle into a new DC
                       state, where the capacitors are again open-circuits.
                       In between will be an interval during which currents and voltages are changing as the capacitors
                       charge or discharges. Since these lasts for only a short time, this is known as a transient effect.

             AC − circuits are circuits where the voltage (current) varies with time typically like a sine and cosine.
                   Currents and voltage are changing continuously, sop capacitors are charging and discharging
                   continuously.


             A source is a device that converts non-electrical energy to electrical energy are a battery which converts
             chemical energy to electrical energy and a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.

             The circuit symbol for a dc source is

             An electromotive force (emf) of a source is defined to be the amount of work done per a unit charge by the
             source in transferring a charge from one terminal to the other

        Alternating Current Circuits
        An alternating current circuit (ac) is a circuit where the voltage and the current vary with time typically like
        a sine or a cosine. A typical ac signal may be given as

                                                     =
                                                    vV   sin ( tω  β +  )
            v is the voltage at a given instant of time and is called instantaneous voltage.

            V is the maximum value of the voltage and is called the amplitude of the voltage.
            ω is the number of radians executed per second and is called the angular frequency of the voltage.


        It is related with

            Frequency (f) as ω = 2πf
            Period (T) as ω = 2π ⁄ T.
            β is called the phase angle of the voltage.


        Its effect is to shift the graph of sin ( ) tω  either to the right (if negative) or to the left (if negative).

        Phase angle of signal 2 minus the phase angle of signal 1 is called the phase shift of signal 2 with respect to
        signal 1.

        The one with a bigger phase angle is said to be leading the other and the one with a smaller phase angle is
        said to be lagging from the other.

        If      v =  V  sin ω  (  t β +  )  and v =  V  sin ω  (  t β +  ) , then θ  β =  β −

             Current

             Instantaneous current is defined to be amount of charge  dQ  that crosses a cross-sectional area in

             Drift Velocity of Electrons


             Normally the electrons are normally colliding with each other. If there is no electric field, the net velocity
             of the electrons with zero. But if there is a net electric field, the electrons will have a net velocity opposite
             to the directions of the electrons. This velocity is called the drift velocity of electrons. Even though the
             carriers of charges are negative charges (electrons), conventionally it is assumed that the carriers of charge
             are positive charges.
             Thus, the direction of current density is taken to be the direction of movement of positive charges which is
             the same as the directions of the electric field.

        Capacitance and Dielectric


        A Capacitor is two conductors (or more) separated by an insulator. A capacitor is used to store charges or
        electrical energy. The circuit symbol of a capacitor is






































        When a capacitor is connected to a potential difference (such as a battery), charges are transferred from
        one of the conductors to the other conductor, and both conductors acquire equal but opposite charge. The
        charge accumulated is directly proportional to the potential difference between the conductors. That is
                                                     Q     constant

        Where Q is charge accumulated by the conductors and ΔV is the potential difference between the
        conductors. The constant of proportionality is called the capacitance of the capacitor and denoted by C.
                                                         Q  =  C

        The unit of measurement for capacitance is coulomb/volt which is defined to be the Fared abbreviated as
        F.

        Parallel Plate Capacitor

        Two parallel plates separated by an insulator. From symmetry, the electric field is uniform and
        perpendicular to the plate inside (between) the plates and approximately zero outside the plates.
        If the charge density is δ, an expression for the electric field can be obtained by using Gauss’s law by
        taking the Gaussian surface to be the cylindrical surface shown.]]></page><page Index="425"><![CDATA[A ppe ndi x   C  | 409














             The electric flux crossing part of the cylinder outside the plates is zero because the electric field outside the
             plates is approximately zero. The electric flux on the curved surface inside plates is zero because the area
             vector and the electric field perpendicular to each other. The only contribution to the electric flux comes
             from the end face inside the plates. If the area of the end face is A then

        Parallel Combination of Capacitors

        Capacitors are said to be connected in parallel if they are connected in a branched connection as shown














        Capacitors connected in parallel have the same potential difference because the conductors on the same
        side are connected by conductors and are at the same potential but the charge will be divided among the
        capacitors according to their capacitances. So the total charge is equal to the sum of the charges of each
        capacitor.

             Series Combination of Capacitors

             Capacitors are said to be connected in series when they are connected in one line.




             When capacitors are connected in series are connected to a potential difference, electrons are taken from
             one of the outermost conductors and taken to the outermost conductor on the other side. All the conductors
             in between are charges by induction.

             Thus, in a series combination all of the capacitor will acquire the same charge which is also equal to the
             total charge acquired by the capacitors.
             The total potential difference across the combination will be divided into the capacitors according to their
             capacitance.

             Capacitors with Dielectrics

             A dielectric is an insulator placed between the conductors of a capacitor. A dielectric is used to increase the
             capacitance of a capacitor consider the parallel plate capacitor shown


















             The charges in the plates of the capacitor will set up an electric field directed from the positive plate
             towards the negative plate. Let the strength of this field be  E .
                                                                       0
             This is also the field between the capacitors when the plates are separated by vacuum (or air). This electric
             field will exert force on the modules of the dielectric. The negative part of a molecule will be pulled
             towards the positive plate and the positive part of the molecule will be pulled towards the negative plate.

             Thus, the molecules of the dielectric will set up their own electric field directed from their positive end
             towards their negative and which is opposite to the electric field set up by the charges on the plates. The net
             electric field between the plates is the field due to the charges in the plates minus the field due to the
             molecules of the dielectric.
             Thus, the electric field strength with a dielectric is less than the field strength without a dielectric. The ratio
                                                         ( )

             magnetic field inside the coil. That is there is magnetic flux crossing the loops of the coil due to its own
             magnetic field.
             If the current changes with time, then the magnetic field inside the coil will change with time which implies
             the magnetic flux crossing the coil will change with time. According to Faraday’s law, this change in
             magnetic flux will produce induced  mfε   in the coil. This kind of induced  mfε   is called self induced  mfε

             because it is caused by the current in the coil itself.
















                          ε
             Self-induced  mf  is directly proportional to the rate of change of current in the coil. The constant of
             proportional between the self induced  mfε   and the rate of change of current in the coil is called
             inductance (L) of the coil.

                                 dt
             The negative sign indicates that the polarity of the self-induced  mfε   is in such a way aas to oppose the

             cause for the change in flux which is the rate of change of current with time. (It essentially represents
             Lenz’s rule)
             The unit of measurement for inductance is volt/(Ampere/second) which is defined to be the Henry,
             abreviated as H.

             Inductance of a Solenoid in terms of its geometry

        Kirchhoff’s Rules

        Kirchhoff’s Rules are rules used to solve complex circuits.

        A junction in a circuit is a point where two or more wires meet.










        A simple loop is a non-intersecting loop or a loop that is not divided into more than one loop









                                        Simple loop            Not a simple loop
        Kirchhoff’s junction rules states that the sum of all the currents in a junction is zero
                  ∑     I =  I +  1  I +  2  I +  3   =  0


                junction



        Kirchhoff’s loop rules states that the sum of all the potential differences in a loop is zero
                ∑   ∆ V = ∆ V +∆  V +∆   V +      = 0

                loop


        Sign Convention
        Currents directed towards the junction are taken to be positive while currents directed away from the
        junction are taken to be negative. It is easier to treat the variables as positive & represent a negative as the
        negative of the variable (for example, if a current I is negative it will be written as –I)

        The potential difference across a battery (source) is taken to be positive if transversed from its negative to
        its positive terminal & is taken to be negative if transversed from its positive terminal towards its negative
        terminal

             The potential difference across a resistor is taken to be negative if transversed in the direction of the current
             and positive if transversed opposite to the direction of the current












             Applying Kirchhoff’s loop

             1.  Assign variables & directions to the currents in all the wires of the circuit. Direction is assigned
                arbitrarily. If after solving the problem the current turns out to be positive, then the assigned direction is
                the correct direction. If the current turns out to be negative than the actual direction is opposite to the
                assigned direction.

             2.  Assign transverse directions (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise) to all of the simple loops of the
                circuit. Choice of a transverse direction is arbitrary. It is the direction in which Kirchhoff’s loop rule is
                to be applied.

             3.  If there are n junctions, apply Kirchhoff’s junction will not result in an independent equation.
             4.  Apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to all of the simple loops of the circuit.

             5.  Solve the resulting system of linear equations.]]></page><page Index="436"><![CDATA[420 |  A ppe ndi x   C

        Examples


        Solving a circuit with transient changes

        1.  Determine the DC voltages on the capacitors before the change occurs. These may be given, or you
            may have to solve for them from the original configuration.

                                                           0
        2.  Let the change occur instantaneously at time t = . The capacitors will maintain their voltages into the
            instant just after the change. (Recall: capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously.)

        3.  Analyze the circuit using standard methods (node-voltage, mesh-current, etc.) Since capacitor currents
            depend on   dv  , the result will be a differential equation.
                       dt

        4.  Solve the differential equation, using the capacitor voltages from before the change as the initial
            conditions.


        5.  The resulting equation will describe the charging (or discharging) of the capacitor voltage during the
            transient and give the final DC value once the capacitor is fully charged (or discharged).

             Christian Kramp in 1808.

             Factorial on any number is the product of positive less than or equal to that number (n).

             Double Factorial
             The product of all odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, denoted
             by  !!n .
