You are in an airplane flying from Chicago to Boston for a job interview. The compass in the                cockpit of the plane shows that your plane is pointed due East, and the airspeed indicator on the                plane shows that the plane is traveling through the air at 400 mph. there is a crosswind that affects                your plane however, and the crosswind is blowing due South at 40 mph.                Given the crosswind you wonder; relative to the ground, in what direction are you really flying and                how fast are you really traveling?            29.  A jet airliner, flying due east at 500 mph in still air, encounters a 70-mph tailwind blowing in the                direction 60° north of east. The airplane holds its compass heading due east but, because of the                wind, acquires a new ground speed and direction. What speed and direction should the jetliner have                in order for the resultant vector to be 500 mph due east?            30.

A bird flies from its nest 5 km in the direction 60° north east, where it stops to rest on a tree. It then                flies 10 km in the direction due southeast and lands atop a telephone pole.

A nonempty set of                        n              vectors     is called an orthogonal set if all pairs of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal. An               orthogonal set of unit vectors is called an orthonormal set.                Example               The floor of your room (extended to infinity) is a subspace V. The line where two walls meet is a              subspace W (one-dimensional). Those subspaces are orthogonal. Every vector up the meeting line is              perpendicular to every vector on the floor. The origin (0, 0, 0) is in the corner.

The plane vector in     has to go through (0, 0, 0).                                                0                 From rule (2), if we choose  k =  and the rule requires 0v to be in the subspace.                 The axioms that are not inherited by W are               Axiom 1 – Closure of W under addition              Axiom 4 – Existence of a zero vector in W               Axiom 5 – Existence of a negative in W for every vector in W              Axiom 6 – Closure of W under scalar multiplication                                                                      37","Example                                       )           Keep only the vectors ( , xy  whose components are positive or zero (first quadrant “quarter-plane”).                                                    )                           )                                             −                                                 −           The vector (2, 3  is included but ( 2, 3  is not.  So, rule (2) is violated when we try  k = − 1. The           quarter-plane is not a subspace.             Example            Include also the vectors whose components are both negative. Now we have two quarter-planes. Rule (ii)                                                                                    )           satisfies when we multiply by any c. But rule (i) fails.  The sum of v =  (2, 3 and w =  ( 3,−  −  2 ) is ( 1, 1−  )           which is outside the quarter-plane. Two quarter-planes don’t make a subspace.             Example                          C           The Subspace  (−∞   , ∞ )           There is a theorem in calculus which states that a sum of continuous functions is continuous and than a           constant times a continuous frunction is continuous. In vector word, the set of continuous functions on           (−∞ , ∞ ) is a subspace of  (−∞ , ∞ ) .
