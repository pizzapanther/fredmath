Hooke’s law in physics states that the length x of a uniform spring is a linear function of the force y                   applied to it. If we express the relationship as  y =  mx b+ , then the coefficient m is called the spring                   constant.                              Suppose a particular unstretched spring has a measured length of 6.1 inches.(i.e., x = 6.1 when                     y =  0 ). Forces of 2 pounds, 4 pounds, and 6 pounds are then applied to the spring, and the                   corresponding lengths are found to be 7.6 inches, 8.7 inches, and 10.4 inches.
