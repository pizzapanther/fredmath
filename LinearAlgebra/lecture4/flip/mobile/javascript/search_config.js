Also B – 5I must have the               same rank 2. Its nullspace has dimension 3 − 2 = 1. So each similar matrix B also has only one               independent eigenvector.                                       T               The transpose matrix  J  has the same eigenvalues 5, 5, 5, and  J T  − 5I  has the same rank 2. Jordan’s                                 T               theory says that  J  is similar to J.  The matrix that produces the similarity happens to be the reserve               identity M:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    500        00 1 5 1 0 00 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               T                     J =   M − 1 JM  is      1 5 0 =      01 0 0 51 01 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0 1 5        1 00 005 1 00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (                                                         )                                                (                                                                                                T               There is one line of eigenvectors  x 1 , 0, 0  for J and another line  0, 0, x 3 )  for  J .                                                                 305","Fibonacci Numbers           Every new Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous F’s.

Jordan Form           For every A, we want to choose M so that  M − 1 AM  is as nearly diagonal as possible. When A has a full set          of n eigenvectors, they go into the columns of M. Then M = P. The matrix  P − 1 AP is diagonal.          If A has s independent eigenvectors, it is similar to a matrix J that has s Jordan blocks on its diagonal.         There is a matrix M such that                                                            J   1                                                     M  − 1 AM =               =  J                                                                   J                                                                      s           Each block in J has one eigenvalue λ , one eigenvector, and 1’s above the diagonal:                                             i                                                         λ   1       0                                                          i                                                              J =                                                                  i               1                                                                                                                                           λ   i            A is similar to B if they share the same Jordan form J – not otherwise.                                                                                                         308","Exercises            Section 4.5 – Diagonalization                 1.
